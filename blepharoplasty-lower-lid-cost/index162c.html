Add $350 for IV sedation. Most people have it done under local with mild sedation, such as a Valium or Ativan.</p><p>The cost of both upper and lower eyelid surgery is $3900 under local anesthesia. (E. Ronald Finger, MD, Savannah Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The average cost in Southern California is from $2000 to $3500 for <strong>blepharoplasty Lower Lid</strong>. This includes OR and local anesthesia under IV sedation. (Gary H. Manchester, MD (retired), San Diego Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Eyes come in all shapes and sizes and vary in there anatomy between races and ethnicities. But bottom line is, yes different operations are performed on upper versus lower lids. and different operations/techniques are used for different anatomic variants.</p><p>Skin excess leads to skin excision and therefore a scar on the outside; while bulging fatty tissue can be treated with either internal scars. Different surgical options entail different anethesia and equipment options, all of which contribute to costs.</p><p>Be careful signing up for eyelid surgery, or any cosmetic surgery for that matter, based on price alone. Interview as many Board Certified Plastic surgeons as you can in your area. You may find that prices vary; you may also find that each surgeon has different thoughts on how he/she may approach your procedure.</p><p>Find out where incisions will be placed. Remember, the cost of surgery includes many aspects.surgeon, facility fees and access,nursing care, anesthesia care, office local (area of the country), etc.</p><p></p>

<p>Bottom line, you get what you pay for.bargain surgery is just that and may lead to future revisions that might ramp the cost up higher than the original procedure! (John Philip Connors III, MD, FACS, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Cost of Blepharoplasty Lower Lid in Fort Lauderdale, FL</h3><p>The cost of my lower eyelid transconjunctival bleparoplasty runs between 2800-3400 including IV sedation and the in-office operating suite. The lower end of the spectrum would be without concomitant laser resurfacing of the eyelid skin.</p><p></p>

</div>It normally takes 35-40 minutes in total. Fees vary region to region and make certain your doctor performs these routinely and shows you before and after photos. (David S. Felder, MD, Fort Lauderdale Oculoplastic Surgeon)
<p>The cost of a blepharoplasty lower lid will vary significantly based on your geographic area and what needs to be done. For simple fat removal with an incision inside the eyelid (transconjunctival) the cost will be lower than with a skin incision and treatment of excess skin, fat, and muscle.</p><p>In addition, most surgeons will give a discounted price for upper and lower eyelid lifts performed together. Depending on your patient preference, eyelid surgery can often be done with local anesthesia alone, thus avoiding costs associated with surgery centers and anesthesia.</p><p>This is a highly personal decision, however, so you must do what makes you most comfortable.

<h3>How Much Does a Lower Eye Lift Cost</h3><p>The average surgeon’s fee for a lower blepharoplasty is 2500-3000 dollars in my area. This fee is in addition to the operating room fee and anesthesia fee. (Paul Vitenas, Jr., MD, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>I do surgery in Both Beverly Hills and NYC. I can tell you that the cost in NYC is higher because the NY anesthesilogists charge almost double what their Beverly Hills counterparts charge. Also the operating rooms charge more in NYC as well. The cost really depends on your anatomy and what the extent of the procedure that you require would be. (Jason B. Diamond, MD, FACS, Beverly Hills Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>As has been said, the costs vary regionally, by surgeon, and by the complexity of the procedure needed. A ballpark would be $2500-$5000 for most circumstances. Lower lids are very touchy so don’t take surgery lightly here as they are prone to complication far more than upper lids. (Richard P. Rand, MD, FACS, Seattle Plastic Surgeon)</p><p></p>

</div>I charge $2750 for lower lids alone and $4250 for upper and lower lids together. This surgery is done under local anesthesia in my office or if patients want to go to sleep, it is done in a local surgicenter. (Jonathan Pontell, MD, FACS, Philadelphia Facial Plastic Surgeon)
<p>Blepharoplasty pricing vary depending on geographic location and the cost structure of the surgeon. Expensive areas such as New York or Los Angeles or areas with fewer board certified plastic surgeons will have higher prices than South Florida. We start Lower Blepharoplasty at $2000 + MD Anesthesia Related Expenses (if necessary). You should consult with surgeons who own his or her own nationally accredited surgery center for the highest standard of care and for cost containment. (Kris M. Reddy, MD, FACS, West Palm Beach Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The price of a lower blepharoplasty will vary depending on the surgeon you choose, the location in the country, the facility in which you have your surgery, and how much correction is needed. It would commonly range anywhere from about $2,000 to almost $6,000. (Larry S. Nichter, MD, MS, FACS, Orange County Plastic Surgeon)</p><p></p>

<p>Most often now, fat is not removed from the lower eyelids. We need our fat and the face is like a balloon that deflates. Often injections of Restylane, Radiesse can be done in place of surgery but filling in the naso jugal groove or the hallow. When surgery is done, we reposition the fat into the hollows. (Cynthia Boxrud, MD, Santa Monica Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p><p>Cost is always uppermost in every ones mind.The cost will vary from region the the country to the next.It is also important to understand that not every lower eyelid lift is the same.some involve simple removal of fat and others may require tightening of the lower lid.so the cost can be anywhere from 1500 to 3500 dollars.

</div>Blepharoplasty Lower Lid fees in total range from $2500-$6000 in Southern California. Physicians who advertise more are often more expensive. If you are considering this procedure, focus on the credentials of your surgeon and your potential to achieve the results you seek. This is one of the more difficult procedures in plastic surgery, and not one you’ll want to have revised. (Jason Hess, MD, San Diego Plastic Surgeon)
<h3>Lower Eye Lift Cost</h3><p>Great question the US average is including all fees around $2,000. Seek 3 in person evaluations from boarded surgeons in your area. Remember fees adjust if additional options are done, like a canthopexy, tear trougfh fillers, etc. (Darryl J. Blinski, MD, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Cost of the surgery to the patient is determined by three things:</strong></p><ol>
<li>The surgeon fee</li>
<li>The facility (where the surgery is being done) fee and</li>
<li>Anesthesiologist fee.</li>
</ol><p></p>

In some cases if the case is being done in the surgeons office, the facility and anesthesia fee may be minimum. If the surgery is being done at a hospital the facility fee tends to be much higher. Cost is also determined by location. A surgeon in Cincinnati is going to pay a lot lower for overhead than someone on park avenue thus the fees would tend to be much lower. Also some surgeons elevate their fees to create the appearance of quality.
<p>If you pay a lot for something it must be good right? On the flip side if someone is willing to do surgery for twenty dollars, what is the product you are getting? That being said, surgeons in demand can have the luxury to increase their prices because people still want surgery with them. Depending on amount and time lower eyelid blepharoplasty in New Jersey is anywhere from $3000 to $6000. Hope this helps. (Chris Thiagarajah, MD, Denver Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p><p></p>

</div>The lower eyelid surgery surgical fee is variable, in my practice it ranges from 2-3 K, in addition there is an operating room charge of 1-2 K. The reason for the price difference is the degree of correction required.
<p>In one patients the surgery would involve only correction of fat pockets, on the other end of the spectrum would be a patient in whom I need to correct many other tissue planes, such as canthal tendon, orgicularis muscle, etc.</p><p>As a patient you need to be able to trust your surgeon to have the talent, expertise and experience to properly assess your anatomical needs and perform appropriate surgery. Only then would you obtain the youthful natural look of your lids. (Boris M. Ackerman, MD, Newport Beach Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Lower Blepharoplasty Cost in Atlanta</h3><p>If upon examination, the required surgery to rejuvenate your lower eyelids is the Blepharoplasty procedure, then the cost at our facility is normally $3,500.00. Make sure when choosing a facility for any procedure that the physician is a Board Certified Plastic Surgeon, the Facility is State licensed and that the anesthesia provided is by a MD Anesthesiologist. We have all of the above. Safety first. (Vincent N. Zubowicz, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>As stated by other physicians here, the costs tend to average anywhere from $2000-4000 for a traditional straightforward lower lid blepharoplasty. However, costs can vary depending on the anatomy and the complexity of the planned procedure.</p><p></p>

Lower eyelid surgery can involve a simple skin excision which can be performed in the office under local anesthesia to complex procedures requiring either conscious sedation or general anesthesia and, possibly, the use of a hospital operating room.</p><p>If you only require a simple skin excision, the cost could be anywhere from $2,000 to $4,000. However, if you require a more complex procedure in the operating room, the charges could be anywhere from $4,000 to $12,000.

</div>The cost of any plastic surgery procedure will depend on your plastic surgeons location, his experience, the type of procedure, and wear the procedure is done.In my practice at the Indiana Plastic Surgery Center, the cost of blepharoplasty lower lid is generally $2750.  This may seem lower than most but I am able to perform this procedure in the office setting under local anesthesia with oral sedation.
<p>This removes the facility fees of outpatient surgery center and anesthesia fees out of the equation making this more affordable.My lower eyelid procedure involves an incision just below the eyelashes, a possible removal of excess fat, a tightening of the obicularis muscle just below the skin (to support the lower eyelid) and a general removal of skin.  The procedure takes about 2 hours and right after the procedure, the patient gets up and goes home.</p><p>There is no lengthy recovery room process needed. The recovery is 2 weeks to being “presentable” but the healing is ongoing for months as the repairs heal and the soft tissue swelling completely resolves.Be sure to find a plastic surgeon certified by the American Board of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery.
