The key is locating the scars in a place which is not noticeable, and meticulous wound closure and care to minimize scars.</p><p>For upper eyelid surgery, incisions are usually made in the eyelid crease, so when it heals it is not noticeable.</p><p>For lower eyelids, incisions are made on the inside of the eyelid (for fat removal or repositioning) or just below the eyelash line to conceal it. Closure can also make a difference.</p><p>I prefer subcuticular (just below the skin surface) closure with a suture which is removed in 5-7 days to minimize scarring.</p><p>So-called absorbable sutures can often disolve too early causing wound breakdown or too late enhancing the scar. (Carlo Rob Bernardino, MD, Monterey Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p><h3>They are typically well-hidden!!</h3><p>When eyelift or blepharoplasty is performed well and a patient takes good care of the scars, they tend to turn out beautifully.</p><p>The scars for the upper lids are placed deep into a natural crease that is not visible when the eyes are open.</p><p>The lower lids may or may not have a scar left behind. If there is an external scar on the lower lid, it tends to be right below the lash line.</p><p>Ultimately if you wear makeup, the scar essentially disappears. (Manish H. Shah, MD, FACS, Denver Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Excellent scars with eyelid surgery</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_525" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-a02e3536d677ec7abba3c40f82b44f46">

</div><p>Eyelid skin is among the thinnest skin in the body which means that it is usually very hard to see scars from eyelid surgery. As with any types of scars there are several post op treatments to minimize any scarring. (Joshua Korman, MD, Mountain View Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Scars from blepharoplasty surgery</h3><p>Blepharoplasty of the lower eyelids may be performed from inside the eyelid, which would leave no visible scar. Alternatively, an external incision right below the eyelashes allows removal of excess lower eyelid skin. Upper eyelid blepharoplasty does require a scar but it is usually unnoticeable and hidden in the eyelid crease. (Olivia Hutchinson, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Blepharoplasty scars</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_527" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>On the face, every millimeter counts. Nowhere is scarring more devastating to your appearance, or to your surgeon’s reputation. Thankfully, upper eyelid scars are generally almost invisible.</p><p>The fine line resulting from this surgery should be placed precisely in a naturally occurring skin crease. The eyelid skin is one of the few body regions that is nearly immune to keloid formation. (Jason R. Hess, MD, San Diego Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Scars after eyelid surgery</h3><p>Visible scars are very rare after blepharoplasty (eyelid surgery). The upper lid incision is hidden in the natural crease and the lower one is very close to the lash line, or sometimes there is no external insion at all (transconjuntival (inside the lid) approch combined with laser resurfacing o tighten the skin).</p><p>In rare instances here migt be a tendency to thickened scar formation that can be anticiapeted and/or treated. (Andrew Pichler, MD, Sacramento Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Scarring after eyelid lift</h3><p>Blepharoplasty, or an eyelid lift, should cause minimal to no visible scars. The upper eyelid scar should be well hidden in the upper eyelid crease and any scar outside that crease should fall into one of the crow’s feet wrinkles. Lower eyeylid scars should be well hidden 2 millimeters below the lower lash line and are camoflauged well by a shadowing effect and the lashes. (Etai Funk, MD, Houston Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Scarring from Eyelid Surgery</h3><p>Incisions for upper and lower eyelid surgery heal extremely well. One should expect essentially minimal or no visible scarring within 6 months to 1 yr, if not sooner. The incisions for upper blepharoplasty are placed within natural creases and those for lower blepharoplasty are either placed within a natural horizontal crease below the lash line or on the inside of the eyelid (eg transconjunctival approach). (Amir M. Karam, MD, San Diego Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Incisions After Eyelid Surgery – In general, scars after eyelid surgery become almost imperceptible after 4-6 weeks. (Rod J. Rohrich, MD, Dallas Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Eyelid Surgery Scars</h3><p>Barely perceptible scarring occurs from eyelid surgery. The scar is placed carefully in the crease in the upper lid and depending upon your needs either the incision is made inside the eyelid on the lower lid or you may have a scar crease that’s barely visible in the natural smile line in the corner of your eye.</p><p>That decision will take place at the time of your consultation. (Paul Vanek, MD, Cleveland Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Minimal Scar In Blepharoplasty When Performed by a Skilled Surgeon</h3><p>Typically, both upper and lower blepharoplasty procedures do not produce highly visible scars because of the placement of the incisions.</p><p>In the upper eyelid, the incision is made in the natural crease of the eyelid. In the lower eyelid, the incision is most commonly made inside the lower lid, and is thus externally invisible.</p><p>There are even some laser procedures that can be performed post-surgery to further minimize the appearance of the upper lid scar.</p><p>However, if performed by a skilled surgeon who has removed an appropriate amount of skin from the upper lid and created a careful incision and closure, the procedure should leave very little visible scar. (Lawrence Bass, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Scars from eyelid surgery</h3><p>The scars with upper eyelid surgery are placed in the crease so they remain extremely hard to see. The lower eyelid scar is usually placed under the lashes, or just barely inside the eyelid as to remain invisible.</p><p>Consult with a Board Certified Plastic Surgeon, certified by The American Board of Plastic Surgery (ASPS), and ask to see some before and after photos. This surgery is usually an outpatient procedure. (Robert E. Zaworski, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>The scarring from upper and lower lid blepharoplasty are barely perciptible</h3><p>The skin of the upper and lower lids is among the thinnest in our body. Because of this and the natural redundancy of tissue in the area, incisions can be placed in such a way to hide them in nearly all cases. In lower lid surgery the incision is often placed in the conjunctiva or mucosal lining of the lower lid.</p><p>During the healing period the incisions may become a little red and occasionally one may get small inclusion cysts, however both often fade with time. This procedure is often a favorite among experienced and well trained surgeons because of the dramatic effect it can have on rejuvenating the upper third of the face. (Giancarlo Zuliani, MD, Rochester Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Eyelid surgery scars can be well hidden</h3><p>In the upper eyelid, surgical scars can often be expertly hidden in the natrual crease. The same goes for the lower eyelid if the incision is made on the outside of the eyelid.</p><p>If the incision is behind the lower eyelid, no scar is seen. (Brett S. Kotlus, MD, MS, New York Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Blepharoplasty and Scars</h3><p>It is VERY rare to have visible scars following Blepharoplasty. Eyelids skin is usually very thin and heals very well even in patients who have tendencies to create Keloids scars. The most important feature of upper Blepharoplasty is to avoid going to lateral into the crow’s feet where the skin is thicker and the scar can show. Lower eyelid Blepharoplasty is even more forgiving with the scar being right under the eyelashes and healing very well. Redness of the scars can last for few weeks but rapidly they will turn white and disappear. (Henri P. Gaboriau, MD, Seattle Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Inconspicuous eyelid surgery scars</h3><p>With any incision – there will be a scar. Typically, the eyelid skin is thin and visible scarring is minimal, and in an area that is well hidden. I have found that surgical experience allows for a more attractive, natural result. (George John Alexander, MD, FACS, Las Vegas Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Eyelid Surgery (Blepharoplasty) Scars</h3><p>Eyelid surgery scars are among the best scars possible. The eyelid skin is thin, and the incisions are placed in the normal curves of the lids to make them less noticeable. Upper eyelid scars tend to hide in the fold above the eye, whenever the eye is open.</p><p>Even with the eye closed the scar is normally thin and flat, making detection difficult. Lower eyelid scars can, in younger patients, be placed inside the eyelid, or more commonly along the curve of the lid, just below the lashes.</p><p>Most the time they are hard to see by the time the bruising has resolved. While there can be no guarantees in medicine, The scars left after blepharoplasty are rarely problematic. (Joseph Mele, MD, Walnut Creek Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Scarring should not be visible after eyelid surgery</h3><p>There should be minimal or no eyelid scarring after upper eyelid surgery. The incisions for the upper eyelids are placed in the natural crease of each eyelid and are closed using special plastic surgery sutures.</p><p>For the lower lids, the incision is either inside the eyelid or just under the lash line so the incision should also heal nicely. It is best to make sure your surgeon specializes in eyelid surgery to help ensure that your incisions have the best chance possible of healing nicely. (Andrew Miller, MD, Edison Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Eyelid Surgery Incisions with Blepharoplasty</h3><p>The benefit of cosmetic surgery of the eyes, face, and neck should outweigh the risks. Everyone who has surgery will have a scar where the incision was placed.</p><p>Even the best eyelid surgery (blepharoplasty) by top plastic surgeons will have visible scars, if one looks close enough. Fortunately, most eyelid surgery scars are inconspicuous.</p><p>Regardless of a plastic surgeon’s specific eyelid surgery technique (transconjuctival, subciliary, pinch, etc), all eyelid incisions are hidden in natural creases and boundaries.</p><p>The facial incisions may vary in length dependent on the specific technique and a person’s unique anatomy. Eyelid surgery scars may look troublesome early after surgery, but usually fade and soften over time.</p><p>A poorly healing scar is always a risk with cosmetic surgery, but that risk is usually small.</p><p>Only after a comprehensive evaluation by a eyelid surgery plastic surgeon can he/she help determine appropriate options for you.  (Houtan Chaboki, MD, Washington DC Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Bleph scars are minimal</h3><p>After either upper or lower Blepharoplasty surgery the scars are minimal and should not be a problem.</p><p>The scars are placed where they will be least visible and frequently are not visible unless you know where they are or are very close. (Walter D. Gracia, MD, Fort Worth Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Eyelid surgery, blepharoplasty, scarring</h3><p>Eyelid surgery is one of the rare surgeries where it is almost a guarantee that the scarring will be very close to immperceptible. Even in patients with a history of problematic scarring in other areas of their body, scarring in the eyelilds is generally very acceptable. The scars are placed in the crease in the upper lid and, just underneath the lashes in the lower lids. The pinkness that exists in the scars early post-operatievel is generally resolved in six to eight weeks. (Patti A. Flint, MD, Scottsdale Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Blepharoplasty scars</h3><p>For the upper lid, there will invariably be a small scar, but it is placed in the existing upper eyelid crease where it hides very well. In some situations the incision is carried out toward the crow foot area, but it also tends to heal very well here as well.</p><p>For the lower lids, incision can be placed either on the inside of the lower lid (transconjuctival – where it would not be see at all) or directly on the skin just below the lash line. Like with the upper eyelids, this skin generally heals very well. (Thomas A. Lamperti, MD, Seattle Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Choosing incision patterns for eyelid surgery – minimizing scars</h3><p>Scarring from blepharoplasty is miminal as the thin dermis of the eyelid is not prone to hypertrophy if an experienced surgeon places the scar in the ideal location along the tarsal crease. (Raffy Karamanoukian, MD, FACS, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Scar-free blepharoplasty</h3><p>I can’t speak for everyone, but none of my patients have scars 4 weeks after surgery. The trick in doing this is simple. Take your time, and close the incisions meticuluosly. I have a technique to carefully run the sutures under the skin for upper eyelids.</p><p>This produces a faint, pink line on the upper eyelids for 2-3 weeks which is easily covered by eye shadow or eye make-up. Even if you wear nothing, it blends into the natural crease and is hard to see. After about 4 weeks, you cannot see the scars at all. If lower blepharoplasty is sone through the inside of the eyelid (transconjuctival), there are no incisions at all on the outside. If there excess skin that needs to be removed, a small incision is made right under the lashes which cannot be seen 2-4 weeks after surgery. Check out my youtube video if you want to see this procedure. Search for “blepharoplasty Houston” (Raghu Athre, MD, Houston Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Scars there, but barely after upper eyelid surgery</h3><p>Whenever an incision is made in skin, there will be a scar. This is a fact of nature that to-date, science has not solved.</p><p>However, all scars are not created equal. Upper eyelid skin is the best healing skin on the body and heals so well that it is darn hard to see in the vast majority of cases.</p><p>Add to this fact that when the eyes are open the scar is hidden from view, almost 100% of people consider the scar a complete non-issue. (Louis W. Apostolakis, MD, Austin Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Blepharoplasty Scar Visibility</h3><p>Blepharoplasty (Eyelid Lift) scars are almost invisible. Depending on the procedure, they are hidden in the upper lid crease (which makes them invisible when the eye opens), under the lower lashes (which makes them very hard to see since they are covered by the lashes and in women, by make up) or in side the lower lid lining (transconjunctival) which you can barely see if you pull your lower lid forward and bend it over.</p><p>The eyelids heal rapidly and with hardly visible scars in the vast majority of people. (Peter A. Aldea, MD, Memphis Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Eyelid scars well hidden</h3><p>In most cases the scars that result from cosmetic eyelid surgery are well hidden and almost imperceptible after several weeks. Occasionally a scar problem may occur and can be addressed with a scar revision. (Talmage J. Raine, MD, FACS, Champaign Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Visible scars from Blepharoplasty</h3><p>Most commonly upper eyelid blepharoplasty incisions are made in the eyelid crease. This is the natural crease above your eyelid edge. These SHOULD NOT be visible after blepharoplasty in the upper eyelid. When I perform a lower eyelid blepharoplasty I may choose to remove skin after I remove fat or the puffiness in the eyelid.</p><p>When I do, I make an incision laterally near the side of the eye that continue to the middle of the eyelid. These incisions are visible immediately postoperative but over time (3-6 months) are hidden under the lashes and non noticeable.I discuss this with my patients beforehand always and if they don’t want any possible visible incision mark, I do not remove skin in the lower lid. This is with the understanding that the puffiness that was removed may leave baggy skin.</p><p>In general I recommend against that option to leave the skin but a few patients have opted to go that route. (Chris Thiagarajah, MD, Denver Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Eyelid scars from blepharoplasty should be hard to see</h3><p>The scars from a blepharoplasty, when properly done, should be very difficult to see. The upper eyelid scar is typically hidden in the eyelid fold or crease and the lower eyelid scar is immediately below the lash line if skin has been removed.</p><p>Shortly after the surgery, the scars may be slightly pink but are very easy to conceal with minimal makeup.</p><p>In my experience, it is very uncommon to do a touch-up on a blepharoplasty scar. (Steven L. Ringler, MD, FACS, Grand Rapids Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Visible Scars After Eyelid Surgery</h3><p>As stated here, scars after eyelid surgery can be imperceptible when placed appropriately or invisible when performing lower eyelid surgery without an external incision. Keys to producing a well healed scar in blepharoplasty:</p><ul>
<li>Smaller suture size</li>
<li>Placement of incision in upper lid surgery in the eyelid crease (when crease symmetric bilaterally)</li>
<li>Removal on the right postoperative day</li>
<li>Avoiding undue tension on the eyelid</li>
</ul><p>What may be a more tell-tale sign of a poorly performed eyelid surgery is often a pulled down lid. Myself and a colleague performed a recent study examining this issue and methods to reduce the incidence of this occurring (see link below). (Anil R. Shah, MD, Chicago Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
