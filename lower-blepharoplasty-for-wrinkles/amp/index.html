For fine lines I would use a ViPeel if there were no fat pads or significant loose skin</p><p><strong>Lower eyelid rhytids (wrinkles)</strong></p><p>Fractionated laser resurfacing and chemical peels are both effective at reducing lower eyelid rhytids and tightening the skin to some degree. We use both deep and active FX with good results. Laser is generally better than a TCA peel but is more expensive and takes longer to heal</p><p>TCA peels give quite good results and can be done as a simple office procedure without anesthesia. We also like full strength phenol for the lids.  It can give results approaching the laser. All of these decision need to take into account the patients skin type and such</p><p>It is important to understand any resurfacing can basically treat the rhytids present at rest but there will always remain dynamic rhyids with smiling. There are good studies showing that Botox before the resurfacing will give a better result because the patient isn’t developing new rhytids during the healing phase</p><h3>Resurfacing treatment for management of fine or significant wrinkles under the eyes</h3><p>For management of fine or even more significant wrinkles under the eyes, I suggest that you consider some kind of resurfacing treatment. A fractional CO2 laser could be used or a tunable resurfacing laser could be used to smooth away the wrinkles and tighten the skin in this lower eyelid area<br>

</div>While a TCA peel is effective in tightening the skin to a small degree, it is much more effective for treatment of pigmentation irregularities, and improvement of skin tone and texture. A resurfacing technique would certainly be more effective and long-lasting versus the TCA peel
<p><i>Why don’t you have your lower eyelids operated on also?</i></p><p>I don’t think Fraxel does much. Peels can help. But these things are promoted to avoid surgery. You are having surgery. A well performed lower blepharoplasty can create a smooth lower lid with a long lasting result</p><p>Most of our patients who have lower eyelid surgery have both the upper and lower lids done. </p><p><em>Ablative fractional laser resurfacing best for lower eyelid wrinkles</em></p><p>Chemical peeling can work very well for lower eyelid wrinkles. However, chemical peels can go too deep and cause pigmentation and or scarring if not done correctly. The same holds true for the fractional CO2 lasers, they must be done properly or complications can result<br>

</div>I personally use the Erbium fractional ablative laser to peel the lower eyelid during blepharoplasty. The Erbium laser causes less heat injury, usually results in quicker healing, and has less risk of causing the skin to turn white
<p>The most recent, up to date technique is a combined non-ablative Lux1440 and ablative Lux2940 laser resurfacing. These two fractional Erbium lasers are combined in one treatment and provide excellenmt wrinkle removal and skin rejuvenation with very little risk of scarring or delayed recovery</p><p>You may have to search a while for someone who uses this new technique, however it is an excellent innovation and worth the wait. The eyelids are very thin and susceptible to scarring if careful technique is not used</p><p>See before and after photos of fractional laser treatment.<br>

<strong>Difficult to say</strong><p>Without the benefit of a photo it is hard to say what would work best for you. Most fine superficial wrinkles or even crepey skin is best treated with skin resurfacing by chemical peel or laser</p><p>Redundant skin or lower lid bags is best treated by surgical intervention. </p><p><em>Lower Eyelid Wrinkles</em></p><p>You have several options. Botox would help, but likely would not completely resolve your issues. Some form of skin resurfacing would also improve this region, either laser or a chemical peel. I also feel that you have a slight tear trough deformity which could be helped by filler, and it may add enough volume to help reduce the appearance of your wrinkles. (Satyen Undavia, MD, Philadelphia Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Under eye lines</b><br>

</div>Missdarq, and full of compounding issues. Looking at your photos, especially if this wrinkle just came up in the past 6 months, you are a great botox and filler candidate. A lot of times, botox may all that is needed but sometime additional filler in your under eye hollow and in the outer cheek area may help with these wrinkles.
<p>This can give you almost a years worth of improvement. Sleep apnea is not a disease to fool with especially at your young age. You do not look like the typical sleep apnea patient and your symptoms may be easily treated with just allergy medications and possibly nasal surgery.</p><p>Seek out an injector experienced in your situation. Also look for a good ENT/Facial Plastic surgeon that maybe able to treat you completely! Your on your way to a better you! (Paul E. Goco, MD, Nashville Facial Plastic Surgeon)<br>

</div><h3>Under eye smile wrinkles – how to treat? </h3><p>Botox is the only answer. Wrinkles are caused by muscle contraction and Botox reduces the muscle activity. There is NO surgery that can correct eyelid wrinkles caused by smiling (Brooke R. Seckel, MD, FACS, Boston Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Young with Lower Eyelid Wrinkles</h4><p>The reason you have received a variety of treatment options is because nothing works great for your specific problem. The option I feel which would be most beneficial with little risk would be Botox injections followed 1-2 weeks later with erbium laser skin resurfacing.</p><p>This combined treatment approach is usually helpful, but not perfect given your situation. You should make an appointment with an Oculoplastic Surgeon for comprehensive evaluation and discussion of potential treatment options..<br>

</div>(James R. Gordon, MD, FACS, FAAO, New York Oculoplastic Surgeon)
<p><strong>Are Incisions in Wrinkles in the Forehead Normal in Browlifts?</strong></p><p>More often than not, if you get a mid forehead incision in the wrinkle crease it will not be as invisible as the trichophytic incision at the forehead hairline, and once you have a scar in the middle of your forehead you are stuck with it forever.</p><p>I hope you get another consultation elsewhere before deciding on that course of action. I am quite surprised a well trained plastic surgeon would look at you, with the hairstyle in your photo and even consider a midforehead wrinkle scar (especially when you say you don’t really have deep wrinkles).</p><p>Check credentials thoroughly for all consultants you see.

</div>Mid-Forehead Lifts are less common than other approaches, but provide a powerful approach to the brow area. Yes, scarring is always a distinct possibility. (Robert Shumway, MD, San Diego Facial Plastic Surgeon)
<h3>Mid forehead incisions for brow lift in smooth skin. </h3><p>I would suggest that a trichophytic hairline incision would be a superior approach since you have a smooth forehead and wear your hair in bangs. In my practice it is the preferred approach. It does not take away hair, the scar can eventually be exposed as hair grows through it and the hairline can even be lowered if it is too high ( perhaps that is why bangs flatter your features).</p><p>If you do not have deep horizontal forehead wrinkles, brow lift scars in the mid forehead could very well be a problem. (Sheldon S. Kabaker, MD FACS, San Francisco Facial Plastic Surgeon)<br>

</div><h4>Placement of incisions for forehead lifts.</h4><p>For those patients with receding or elevated hairlines, a crease line incision is helpful. Often, an incision at the junction of the forehead skin and the hairline gives a wonderful result. Endoscopic lift may be a helpful technique, if applicable, in some cases.</p><p>The skin should be very smooth and muscle will be removed to limit frowning. You have some good options. (H. Michael Roark, MD, San Diego Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Mid-Forehead Browlift</em></p><p>I actually presented and authored an article in 1983 on the Mid-Forehad Lift. This is still a procedure used under certain circumstances by a limited number of surgeons. It is utilized more for males than it is for females.</p><p>Also it is easier to hide the incisions in those who have fairly well demarcated transverse forehead “wrinkles” . I noticed that you wear “bangs” anyway, so that may have been part of the decision making of your surgeon.<br>

</div>Certainly an alternative for you would be the “trichophytic” browlift where incisions are made just behind the frontal hairline (my preference). The hairline is actually advanced slightly forward with this procedure and the middle portion of the forehead and the area between your eyes ie the glabella is also lifted.
<p>This is especially important if there is a transverse crease that has developed at the top of your nose. While it is difficult to determine from the single picture submitted it appears to me that you have reasonable eyebrow position and perhaps upper blepharoplasty alone is certainly another realistic option.</p><p><strong>What can you do for wrinkled eyelids?</strong></p><p>A photograph would be helpful so that we can provide better recommendations for treatment or surgery. There are lots of non-surgical and surgical options for wrinkles. Consultations with plastic surgeons in your local area will be the best way to determine the best options for your eyelids. (Gregory Park, MD, San Diego Plastic Surgeon)<br>

</div><h5>Eyelid aging </h5><p>There are many options for eyelid rejuvenation depending on what bothers you and your physical examination. If loose eyelid skin or fat bothers you, then the treatment is typically a surgery called lower blepharoplasty.</p><p>If you have droopy upper eyelids, then a ptosis repair may need to be performed. If the wrinkles around your eyes bother you, that may be addressed with either botox or skin resurfacing (chemical peel or laser).</p><p>You can express your concerns to your surgeon during your consultation and you can come up with a plan that works best. (Sanaz Harirchian, MD, Houston Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>If the problem is excess upper lid skin – an upper lid lift will have excellent result.sFor lines on the lower lids, Botox and a peel or laser are usually a good start.

<i>There is no such thing as a final solution</i><p>The clock never stops.  So do not talk yourself into something you don’t need.  The nonsurgical treatments, which require maintenance are very good.  This included botox and under eye fillers.  When these measures do not get the job done, sure, eyelid surgery can be very good.</p><p> You are in a part of the country where you may not have access to the best aesthetic surgery.  Consider your options carefully. (Kenneth D.
