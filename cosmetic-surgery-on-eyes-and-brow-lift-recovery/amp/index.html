Most patients with saggy upper eyelid skin would benefit from a browlift procedure.</p><p>A small incision brow lift is an elegant procedure which addresses forehead lines and brow ptosis. Nonetheless, I usually describe a brow lift procedure, even if done through small incisions by an experienced surgeon, as a larger (and more costly) procedure than upper eyelid surgery.</p><p>Therefore, my brow lift procedure “includes” upper eyelid surgery but not the reverse is not true. (Lawrence Kass, MD, Saint Petersburg Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p><h3>How to decide between browlift and blepharoplasty?</h3><p>This is definitely an aesthetic problem to get multiple opinions from different surgeons. There is no right or wrong operation in all cases. Some patients require work on their brow, some on their eyelids, some both and some neither. Your surgeon needs to be capable of performing both surgeries equally well.</p><p>In addition, it is very important that you agree with the aesthetic of your surgeon. Here are some important things to know before an evaluation.</p><p>Of the two surgeries, browlifting is the more difficult of the two for the average patient. This is the reason you see such poor results in tabloids and why so many plastic surgeons shy away from this procedure.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_258" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-12f01ac6ec38eb6dbc10b992a0794d3b">

</div><p>It requires a good sense of what needs to be done to improve the aesthetics of the eye and the surgical skill to achieve that result. If your surgeon does not address the brow in your evaluation, heavily discount them as a possibility. Spend some time understanding what makes a beautiful eye. I encourage my patients to pick up a fashion magazine and look at the eyes and eyebrows of the models.</p><p>One things become evident, there is no ideal. There are beautiful models with low brows and minimal eyelid show and others with high arched brows and abundant show. It really is a function of how the eye fits with the rest of the face. Once you have done this, spend some time in the mirror moving your brow and eyelid skin around to find out what looks best. Remember, it is about the look you want to achieve not the specific procedure. If you have an idea of how you want to change things, it will make picking the right surgeon far easier. Be open minded in your evaluations. Listen to what the surgeon recommends and ask questions. One of the best questions to ask is why one over the other.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_260" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>For example, if the surgeon recommends a blepharoplasty, then ask why not a browlift? The answer should center around the aesthetics of your face.</p><p>If the answer is some generality such as ‘too many people do browlifts’ or ‘you’ll end up looking fake’ then you should shy away from this surgeon. Great surgeons tailor the surgery to the problem, mediocre surgeons attack every problem with the same procedure. (Joseph Campanelli, MD, Minneapolis Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Which is better for sagging upper eyelids a Blepharoplasty or Brow Lift?</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_259" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-a02e3536d677ec7abba3c40f82b44f46">

</div><p>This is a great question that comes up in almost every consultation that I have with patients seeking more youthful, attractive eyelids.</p><p>When fullness of the upper eyelids is present in women, not men, it’s necessary to raise the eyebrows into their proper aesthetic position and then see if this results in a change in the amount of excess upper eyelid skin.</p><ol>
<li>If all the excess skin, of the upper eyelid is gone this indicates the excess is caused by low position eyebrows and the proper procedure is a Brow Lift.</li>
<li>If some of the excess upper eyelid skin is gone but some remains this indicates the excess skin is partly from low eyebrows and excess upper eyelid skin. Some, of the skin can be removed with an upper eyelid surgery and the rest will remain unless a Brow Lift is performed at the same time.which is often done.</li>
<li>All the excess upper eyelid skin remains indicating all this excess is due to upper eyelid skin and the proper surgery is an upper eye lift alone. Without performing this simple, but effective brow rest, there’s no way to ascertain which is the proper and therefore most effective solution to upper eyelid saggy skin. An upper blepharoplasty or a Brow Lift. (Francis R. Palmer, III, MD, Beverly Hills Facial Plastic Surgeon)</li>
</ol><h3>Blepharoplasty vs brow lift</h3><p>First, male vs female: brow position is naturally lower in men and more pleasing higher in women. Sweeping higher laterally, not in the center which would give a surperised look. Sometimes just raising the brow will eliminate what appeared to be excess upper eyelid skin, but often both procedure is advisable to give to most esthetically pleasing look , particularly in women.</p><p>There is not definate right or wrong. Esthetics plays a big role so it is personal. (Andrew Pichler, MD, Sacramento Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Browlift and upper and lower blepharoplasty</h3><p>Performing a brow lift or blepharoplasty or a combination of the two depends on several factors, mainly eyebrow position. The position of the eyebrow normally rests at or above the top of the eye socket (superior orbital rim).</p><p>If the eyebrow rests at a normal level, elevation of the eyebrow will do little to help with excess eyelid skin- in these cases a blepharoplasty will suffice. Nonetheless, stabilization of the eyebrow without elevation, called browpexy, may allow for more aggressive removal of eyelid skin if necessary.</p><p>If the eyebrow rests below the top of the eye socket, a brow lift with or without upper and lower blepharoplasty will help with excess skin removal. When the eyebrow droops, the eyelid skin is pushed downward and gives the appearance of excess eyelid skin. In some cases an eyebrow lift is all that is required to sufficiently reduce eyelid hooding caused by excess skin. Elevation of the eyebrow when combined with blepharoplasty is necessary when the eyebrows are low lying and excess eyelid skin is truly present.</p><p>If the outer aspect of the eyebrow is especially low lying, elevation will allow for sufficient removal of eyelid skin, especially at the outer aspect where the most amount of excess skin tends to be found. (Adam J. Cohen, MD, Skokie Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Nonsurgical Brow and Eyelid Rejuvenation May Be Worthwhile Options Before Considering Surgery</h3><p>Fortunately, nowadays a variety of nonsurgical brow and eyelid rejuvenation techniques are available for those who are unsure of how things might look after surgery or are simply unwilling for one reason or another to undergo more aggressive surgical blepharoplasties or brow lifts. There are several nonsurgical approaches to dealing with falling brows (and the resultant saggy, redundant skin that settles right on top of the true upper eyelids).</p><p>This kind of “second eyelid” condition is medically known as dermatochalasis. One nonsurgical approach to the problem is to simply inject a couple of droplets of Botox or Dysport in specific locations along the eyebrows. Sometimes, this alone may result in temporarily raising the brow sufficiently to rejuvenate the brow itself (i.e restore the upward flare of the outer brow) and to pull back some of the saggy skin from the eyelid.</p><p>If additional correction is desired, a small amount of volumizing material, such as Juvederm XC, may be instilled at the same time directly under the middle to outer third of each brow to further elevate and buttress it and to restore a more youthful fullness and projection to the area. If a more permanent solution is desired, a minimally invasive technique, known as the Ten Minute Eyelift, a minimally invasive procedure, may be performed under local anesthesia.</p><p>Here the anesthetized skin of each eyelid is touched by radiowaves that deeply heat the skin below, and which in turn leads to sufficient collagen contraction to pull sagging, redundant lids upward to expose the real eyelid.</p><p>The very fine linear, ivory colored scars that typically result from this technique are completely hidden in the eyelid folds. (Nelson Lee Novick, MD, New York Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h3>Brow lift versus upper and lower blepharoplasty for sagging eyelids</h3><p>This is an excellent question as it goes to the issue of what causes sagging upper eyelids. Sagging eyelids will either be caused by a low set brow, eyelid skin excess, or both.</p><p>I find that most often both contribute to the sagging, and I very frequently will perform a browpexy through the eyelid incision at the same time as the upper and lower blepharoplasty, either to raise the brow a bit, or even just to support it in its current position to prevent it from dropping down, which can happen when the excess skin is removed from the eyelid. (Gary D. Breslow, MD, FACS, Paramus Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Brow Lift is for sagging brows, Eyelid lift is for sagging lids</h3><p>In many clients that are concerned about “sagging eyelids”, sagging brows are a contributing factor. Physical examination by a Plastic Surgeon will determine what the factors are in your situation.</p><p>Plastic Surgeons are ideal for this, as they are also qualified to do brow repositioning when needed, whereas some othe practitioners may only offer the eyelid surgery. (Debra Irizarry, MD, Crestone Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The browlift and blepharoplasty are two procedures that can each produce remarkable results depending on the specific anatomic concerns of the patient.</p><p>A thorough in-person consultation is necessary to determine whether the eyelid, brow, or both can benefit from a rejuvenating procedure.</p><p>If you truly have “sagging eyelids” with excess drooping skin above the eyes, a blepharoplasty may be ideal for removing the redundant skin and tissue of the upper eyelid.</p><p>However if the laxity of your eyelid skin is mostly due to drooping of your brow, then a browlift may lead to a better cosmetic appearance.</p><p>In some situations these two procedures are performed in conjunction to achieve the optimal cosmetic outcome.</p><p>I highly recommend you consult with a board-certified facial plastic surgeon to discuss which option is best for you. ( Stephen P. Smith, Jr., MD , Columbus Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Browlift versus Blepharoplasty</h3><p>Short answer is: it depends. Please consider submitting photographs. The position of the brow is the variable. A droopy brow may be amenable to browlift; this in turn will also have the effect of elevating the eyelids.</p><p>A blepharoplasty, though, focuses on the eyelids, not the brow. ( Anand G. Shah, MD , San Antonio Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Both brow lift and blepharoplasty have their place. If there is a component of brow ptosis a brow lift will be beneficial.</p><p>Most cases still need a blepharoplasty along with the browlift to remove excess skin and not over lift the brows which is not cosmetically pleasing. But in some cases the brow is in good position and all that is needed is the blepharoplasty where only excess skin of the upper eye lid is removed. Brow lift is more commonly done in women vs men since it is a feminizing procedure. Find a board certifed surgeon who does facial rejuvenation for the best results. ( Donald Nunn, MD , Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>It really depends on the shape of your eye and your brow. Most of the time, a sagging brow causes excess skin droop on the eyelid. At times, simply just removing upper eyelid skin worsens the issue. I would recommend a consultation with a board-certified plastic surgeon to discuss your concerns. ( Salvatore Pacella, MD, MBA, FACS , San Diego Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The primary purpose of a browlift is to lift the brows. Although redundant upper eyelid skin may be reduced, the position of the brows will be higher. This is fine if one wishes higher brows but usually gives one a new look, a look one never had before – it can be at times too powerful a change.</p><p>An upper eyelid is more effective at reducing redundant upper eyelid skin and often makes one look like one did at a younger age. ( George Volpe, MD , Boston Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Brow lift or upper lid lift</h3><p>I favor upper lid lift over the brow lift. It can be done under local anesthesia and I believe more effective. If you have a brow lift done, you will still likely need you upper lids done as well. ( Ronald J. Edelson, MD , San Diego Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Blepharoplasty, with or without forheadlift</h3><p>eyelid pathology especially in the upper ones comes from excess of skin and fat protrusion with or without forehead descent.if the skin excess or fat protrusion are the main issues. blepharoplasty will be the perfect the solutionif there is minimum skin excess and that can be corrected with upper lift of the eyebrows, forehead lift will be the best optionunfortunatly, most of the time it is a combination of both.a consultation can help making the right plan ( Jacques Haddad, MD , Montreal Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Droopy eyelids vs droopy brows?</h3><p>Droopy eyelids need upper blepharoplasty with skin skin excision to restore the upper eyes. Many patients also have droopy brows, (the lateral tail of the brow is below the boney prominence, should be one cm above the prominence).</p><p>These patients will benefit from a minimal incision browlift as well. Upper bleph alone may tend to put the brow down even further so it is an important consideration. ( Steven Hopping, MD , Washington DC Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Browlift or Blepharoplasty?</h3><p>For improving the appearance of the upper eyelids, is Blepharoplasty better than Brow lift? The answer is different in each patient.</p><p>Your surgeon can determine whether excess eyelid skin and fat or drooping of the brow is most contributing and suggest Blepharoplasty or Brow lift, or both.</p><p>You can try to guess on your own: if you lift your brow to a pleasing natural-looking position and the eye looks completely better, you may need be a candidate for Brow lift, alone. (Paul C. Zwiebel, MD, Denver Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Browlift vs Blepharoplasty depends</h3><p>There are benefits to both procedures. There is no hard fast answer for which is better. The brows in women should rest at or slightly above the supraorbital rim, in men a little lower.</p><p>In some patients lifting the brows can create a suprised look which patients do not want even though they have some brow ptosis or droopiness.</p><p>This is a personal discussion you have to have with your surgeon. I have found that patients feel that a brow lift has really changed their look whereas a blepharoplasty refreshed their look more.</p><p>You would have to tell me more what you are looking for. (Chris Thiagarajah, MD, Denver Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Browlift Vs Blepharoplasty – Which is Best for Sagging Eyelids?</h3><p>The answer to this question depends on what is causing the sagging eyelids. If your brows are in good position, then blepharoplasty is the operation of choice. Conversely, if the eyelids are within normal limits but the eyebrow is sagging, then browlift is indicated.</p><p>Most people fall in the middle. If you have both droopy brows and excess eyelid skin and puffiness, then you need to consult with your physician to determine whether both surgeries or either surgery is better for you.</p><p>This depends a lot on your expectation of the outcome as well as the severity of your problem. (Sam Goldberger, MD, Beverly Hills Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Eyelid surgery, forehead lift, brow lift</h3><p>Whenever you are considering rejuvenation in the area around your eyes, your plastic surgeon should be evaluating brow position, eyelid position, and the degree of eyelid skin excess before recommending the procedures that will accomplish your goals. Excess upper lid skin can be from sagging brows.</p><p>In that case, when the brow is re-positioned properly, the excess eyelid skin resolves. In other patients, the brow may have remained in excellent position, but there is excess lid skin. In that case, eyelid surgery alone will correct the problem. Any patient seeking eyelid surgery should be examined when any Botox effect has worn off.</p><p>Usually several months after the last injections. Botox can change brow position, and make it difficult to assess which surgery would be best for any given patient. (Patti A. Flint, MD, Scottsdale Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Browlift versus Blepharoplasty</h3><p>On a patient seeking rejuvenation of the upper eyelid area, evaluation of BOTH the brow and the upper eyelid is necessary. If the brow is too low (ptotic), a browlift can help withe eyelid rejuvenation. If too much skin is removed from the eye instead of performing a browlift, brow skin can be removed as well, pulling the brow down further and leading to a excessive fullness in the upper eyelid area. A browlift and a blepharoplasty work in conjunction with each other and should not be thought of as in a mutually exclusive fashion. (Anil R. Shah, MD, Chicago Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Goals are different for BROW LIFT and BLEPHAROPLASTY</h3><p>The goal of blepharoplasty is to create a more youthful and aesthetic appearance of the eyelids. A brow lift is performed to adjust the eyebrow in relation to the eye and the orbit. They are often performed together for complementary reasons. I prefer an open technique for brow lifts to get maximum control for brow placement. (Talmage J. Raine, MD, FACS, Champaign Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Browlift vs. Blepharoplasty for sagging eyelids</h3><p>In general, unless I am doing both procedures together, I like to reduce the amount of skin overhang on upper eyelid prior to completing a browlift. Thus, I would likely recommend a blepharoplasty over a browlift (this could change based on the person’s specific facial anatomy, though).</p><p>As a general rule, a blepharoplasty diminishes skin overhang rather than repositioning the brow; most of the time this gives a better appearance, especially if the brow height is already satisfactory.</p><p>Ultimately, though, this is a matter best determined between you and your plastic surgeon, who will have the benefit of meeting with you in person and tailoring a plan to your face. (Deason Dunagan, MD, Huntsville Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Depends on the caause</h3><p>Anytime a patient presents for either of these procedures the surgeon must asses both. Excess upper eyelid skin can be due to the eyelid itself or due to descent of the brow.</p><p>As the brows move down they will allow for more skin crowding over the upper eyelids. A well positioned female brow should have an arch to it and lie slightly above the bony rim of the eye socket.</p><p>In men it should lie at the rim. Therefore, a quick self assessment should be able to give you an idea of what may be in play. It is definitely cheaper to do only one procedure, but if the problem is both, then solving one will result in an incomplete or poor outcome. (Edmon Pierre Khoury, MD, Lone Tree Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Browlift versus Blepharoplasty- which one is best</h3><p>I prefer browlift because in many cases there is not an excess of upper eyelid skin. Secondly, when you do the upper eyelid surgery, the brow tends to drop a little, giving you a more closed in look.</p><p>Finally, an endoscopic browlift, well done, will give you a great result with minimal scars and none of the deer in the headlights look. (Ricardo L. Rodriguez, MD, Baltimore Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Brow Lift and Blepharoplasty for facial rejuvenation</h3><p>A brow lift (also referred to as a forehead lift) will lift the brow, in turn making the eyes appear more open. This can address concerns with skin between the brow and the eyelid.</p><p>If excess or sagging skin on the eyelid is your concern, an upper blepharoplasty is likely the best solution for you. This procedure removes excess skin on the upper eyelid.</p><p>If you are also concerned about sagging below the eyes, a lower blepharoplasty may be a good option for you too. This procedure removes excess skin and tightens the area underneath the eyes, resulting in a more youthful, rested appearance. (Tarick K. Smaili, MD, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Best way to treat extra eyelid sag</h3><p>As we age, the upper eyelid skin begins to sag. Sometimes, the skin can even hang on or below the eyelashes. Cosmetically, this appearance closes off the eyes and makes you look older but functionally, it is heavy on the eyelid and makes your eyes tired particularly toward the evening.</p><p>The heavy eyelid can sometimes be due to extra skin on the thin upper eyelids but is also often due to droop of the forehead skin and brows. An expert plastic surgeon will be able to evaluate the difference and give you three options for treating the problem.</p><ol>
<li>Upper Eyelid Blepharoplasty: To remove the skin from the upper eyelids</li>
<li>Brow (Forehead) Lift: To raise the position of the forehead skin and brow which will at the same time lift the extra skin off of the upper lid. Oftentimes, you’ll find that the upper lid didn’t have so much extra skin afterall.</li>
<li>Both Most patients require only the upper eyelid blepharoplasty which can be performed in the office without general anesthesia. (Phillip Chang, MD, Leesburg Plastic Surgeon)</li>
