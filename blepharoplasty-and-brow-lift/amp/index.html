Blepharoplasty only address the eyelid skin. Sometimes both are needed. ( Jose E. Barrera, MD, FACS , San Antonio Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>It depends on what end result your looking for. The brow lift is to raise the upper brow so it sits correctly on the brow bone. It may also raise the upper lid a small amount. If you want a lot more upper lid exposure you would need the upper eye lid skin removed along with fats pads.  ( Robert S. Kagan, MD , Elk Grove Village Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Determining The Cause Of Sagging Eyelids</h3><p>It depends on the position of the brow. In principal, during a consultation, the brow must be manipulated and repositioned first in order to decide whether an upper lid blepharoplasty is warranted. Ultimately, the decision is based on discovering the cause of the redundant eyelid skin and moving forward as to which procedure will correct the aesthetic issue, be it an eyelid surgery or brow lift. ( Glynn Bolitho, PhD, MD, FACS , San Diego Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Browlift Vs Blepharoplasty</h3><p>The best option depends on your anatomy. Most of the time the answer is a blepharoplasty. Browlifts are a much less common surgery because a lower set eyebrow can be aesthetically pleasing.</p><p>A careful evaluation of the exact problem can determine the best option. For some patients this may involve both procedures or lateral brow elevation can often benefit from Botox without the need for surgery. ( Susan D. Vasko, MD, FACS , Columbus Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Brow lift Vs Blepharoplasty – Which is Best for Sagging Eyelids?</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_211" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>This is a key decision and one that you should consider carefully before proceeding ahead. The fact is that most people with heavy eyelids have a combination of droopy brows and excess eyelid skin.</p><p>The important thing is to decide whether it is a brow lift or an upper eye lift that gives you the best cosmetic outcome. In some individuals, both procedures may be necessary to get the best possible outcome. An eye lift can typically improve the excess droopy skin that covers the crease of the upper eyelids.</p><p>Eye lifts do not elevate the brow position. Lower Blepharoplasty or lower eye lift can improve bagginess of the lower eyelids and excessive wrinkling that some of us get on the skin of the lower eyelids. ( Arthur M. Cambeiro, MD , Las Vegas Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Depends on what a patient is referring to as “sagging eyes”</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_210" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>The appropriate treatment really depends on what a patient is referring to as “sagging eyes.” Many patients refer to the descent of their eyebrow producing hooding over the upper lid as “sagging eyes,” when actually this is aging of the brow, best treated by a brow lift.</p><p>Loss of elasticity of the skin of the upper eyelid with draping of the soft tissue to the lash line is true aging of the upper lid, best served by blepharoplasty. Often patients demonstrate aging of both the brow and eyelid and benefit from a combined operative procedure. (Larry H. Lickstein, MD , Baltimore Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Browlift vs blepharoplasty depends on the patient</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_212" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-059830fc09ccdf39fcb7a0d700faa343">

</div><p>Customizing the surgical procedure to the patient and their personal aging process and desires will give the most natural results. If you have always had low brows and now just have excess skin on the lids, lifting the brow will give you a new “startled” look rather than restore a natural, youthful appearance.</p><p>However, if you can tell in pictures that your brows are lower than they used to be and they sit below the orbital rim, just removing skin with a blepharoplasty will not give you the best result either. You should see a surgeon who takes the whole picture into account prior to making a plan. Good luck! ( Angela Sturm, MD , Houston Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Brow lift vs Blepharoplasty</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_213" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>The blepharoplasty addresses loose skin on the eyelid. The brow lift addresses the drooping brow. One needs to carefully assess which component is bothersome to the patient and address their concern appropriately. In general, more blepharoplasties are performed than brow lifts.</p><p>A lower, fuller brow is currently considered attractive by today’s standards. A well performed brow lift usually addresses the lateral brow and creates a natural appearance. ( Janet Turkle, MD , Indianapolis Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Browlift and eyelid surgery + volume is the answer</h3><p>Both the brow and the excess eyelid skin contribute to the aging surrounding the eye. To rejuvenate the eyelid area to produce a more youthful look, we need to treat each of these signs of aging.</p><p>We also may need to add “volume” to the eye to produce a more youthful appearance. If we only perform blepharoplasty or an endoscopic brow lift, we may over-correct one or the other of these problems, producing an un-natural appearance.</p><p>Eyelid creases and the position of the brow in relation to the eyelid crease are individual genetic factors. Looking at a picture of a patient when younger, we can get an idea of the ideal relationship of these two items. In addition, a youthful eyelid has volume underneath the brow.</p><p>This volume lifts the brow, to some extent. It also pushes down on the eyelid crease and causes the eyelid crease to have less height. This is what many of the current models in women’s magazines exhibit: increased volume of the brow area.</p><p>Actually, the brow is held up by the youthful eyelid volume. Not all of the models have this eyelid configuration. Twiggy, a generation ago, had an extremely high eyelid crease. Many women like an eyelid crease that allows them to wear eye makeup.</p><p>As a result, we need to tailor our operative procedures to the individual. When we look at the eyelid area and the way it ages, several things happen. As a result, we need to consider the eyelid and the brow as a “unit”, called, in facial plastic surgery, the upper”peri-ocular area” (the area surrounding the eyelid along with the eyelid itself).</p><p>When we look at the anatomy of aging, the brow does fall as the muscles that pull it downward and inward are strong and many. They overcome the one muscle that pulls the brow upward. Botox weakens these “depressor” muscles of the eyelid to produce a younger look.</p><p>A physician, Duchenne, defined these relationships in 1852, so there is not a lot new or debatable about this. We develop an “angry”, “tired”, “mad”, or “sad” appearance if our expressions have caused these muscles to produce aging of the brow.</p><p>Correcting this muscular imbalance can really produce a younger, more relaxed and “happy” look. It is an integral part of the brow lift, which is not really a procedure that only lifts the brow. There is also the problem of excess eyelid skin, called in medicine, blepharochalsis. The skin does loose elasticity and become “crinkled”.</p><p>However, excess removal of this skin can pull the brow down, and excess removal of fat can make the eyelid look “hollow”. There is a balance! In addition, as we lose volume in the eyelid the area “deflates” and the brow drops downward. Areas of the bony eye socket are eroded, further increasing this problem. We can add volume to this area in many ways to achieve a “balance” and a more youthful appearance.</p><p>For our procedures, we look at the individual and assess the aging changes. We tailor surgery of the brow and eyelids and add volume to achieve a natural rejuvenation. Or only one or the other or two of these may be necessary.</p><p>Often our approach will be a “little of several things” rather than a “lot of one thing”. If you wish to have a structured, integrated approach to the “periocular area” see an experienced facial plastic, occuloplastic, or plastic surgeon that can tailor an approach to the whole area that seems sensible to you and recreates (insofar as possible) a more youthful you. (Gregory S. Keller, MD, FACS, Los Angeles Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Brow-lift or Blepharoplasty? – How to tell</h3><p>A physical exam by a board certified Plastic Surgeon or Oculoplastic Surgeon can give you the answer by identifying what is causing your problem. A simple analogy I use with my patients is – Say, you come into a room and see that the curtain is hanging such that it is draped onto the floor.</p><p>You have to analyze the problem first – Is the curtain too long (i.e. redundant eyelid skin) or is the curtain rod (your brow) too low or both? In other words you may need one or the other or both. An easy determination by exam by an expert. Below is some detailed information about both procedures</p><h3>Brow and Eyelids intimately related</h3><p>Facial aging manifests itself in the orbital area as a combination of sagging brow and sagging upper lid skin. Often one is worse than the other, but not always.</p><p>That means that some patients need only single procedure whereas others need to address the brow and the lids.</p><p>A well trained surgeon will be able to identify which patients need which procedure. (Marcelo Ghersi, MD, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>The aging process involves both the eyelid and the brow.</h3><p>The aging process involves both the eyelid and the brow, particularly the lateral brow.</p><p>Lateral hooding of the upper eyelid is best addressed by raising the brow laterally, which can be done through a limited incision in the temple and is usually best combined with a blepharoplasty.</p><p>There are occasional patients who benefit from a browlift without a blepharoplasty, but usually sagging eyelids are a combination of sagging brows and extra eyelid skin.</p><p>The procedures have to be tailored to the patient. An upper blepharoplasty is a simpler procedure with easier recovery, so some patients would prefer to have a blepharoplasty by itself and accept an incomplete correction.</p><p>Only occasionally will patients benefit from a browlift by itself. (Thomas A. Mustoe, MD, FACS, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Browlift or Blepharoplasty</h3><p>The best procedure for your sagging lids really depends on the cause and type of sagging. If you have an extra fold of wrinkled skin on the eyelid itself, then an upper blepharoplasty is appropriate, but if the looseness is a little higher, in the thicker-skinned area right under your eyebrow, and the brow itself is low, than a brow lift will be best.</p><p>It will lift the brow up to a more youthful level, raise the fold of skin just under the brow, and that will smooth out the upper eyelid itself. However, if any loose skin remains on the lid itself, then an upper bleph would still be helpful. (Richard G. Schwartz, MD, West Palm Beach Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Browlift Vs Blepharoplasty</h3><p>Blepharoplasty and brow lifts both help rejuvenate the eye area however, they have two very different purposes. A brow lift will help someone when the actual brow is sagging and a blepharoplasty is for any loose/sagging skin or excess fat above or below the eyelid.</p><p>Most of the time it is one area or the other that will need lifting, but in some cases a person will benefit from doing both. In addition, sometimes patients will mistake a low brow as loose skin on the eyelid and vice versa. That is why it is important to see a patient and determine which of these areas, if not both, need rejuvenation. (Edward E. Dickerson, IV, MD, Fayetteville Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>What is the best for sagging eyelids, brow lift or blepharoplasty?</h3><p>It is impossible to answer this question without seeing your photos. Some patients need one procedure or the other and some require both. If your brows have descended with time then you would probably benefit from a brow lift. You can figure out on your own which is the best procedure or combination for you.</p><p>If you raise your brows with your fingers to a natural level, does this take care of the sagging eyelids? If it does, then a brow lift alone is the answer. If this doesn’t completely take care of the sagging skin, then you would need both procedures.</p><p>If your brow position is good and you have only excess upper eyelid skin, then a upper lid blepharoplasty should do the trick. (Jonathan Pontell, MD, FACS, Philadelphia Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Eyelid surgery produces wonderful results for most patients. The trick is for initial appropriate assessment. Usually you need a reputable Plastic Surgeon with experience, to assess whether it is a forehead sag, or its the eyelids, or sometimes, both.</p><p>To get the best result, get the correct assessment. In my experience over 20 years, it is more commonly the eyelids that cause that tired look. (Mark Edinburg, MBBCH, FRACS, Sydney Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Eye Rejuvenation</h3><p>It’s not that simple. If your brows are low, you may need both. If you have low brows and just get a blepharoplasty, you could actually worsen your appearance.</p><p>Make sure you see a board certified plastic surgeon in your area to examine you correctly and advise you accordingly. (Asif Pirani, MD, FRCS(C), Toronto Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Browlift or Blepharoplasty For Younger Look?</h3><p>Browlifts and blepharoplasty often go hand in hand but not always. As an Oculoplastic surgeon, it’s imperative to examine the patient’s face carefully. Looking at the placement of the brow is important; if it lies on the orbital bone, I would not perform a browlift.</p><p>If a browlift is wrongly performed, an unnatural look can take place. If the issue is lax skin or heavy eyelids, most likely an upper bleph may be the best.</p><p>I always encourage an in-person consultation to carefully consult with the patients to achieve expectations. (Daniel J. Ritacca, MD, Chicago Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Blepharoplasty or brow lift?</h3><p>This depends on whether you have excess eyelid skin, or drooping eyebrows. Sometimes both procedures are necessary. The best thing to do is to schedule a consultation with a board certified Facial Plastic Surgeon for an evaluation. (James Chan, MD, Portland Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>A Browlift By Itself, Blepharoplasty By Itself, Or a Combination of the Two May be Best for You</h3><p>A brow lift and a blepharoplasty are two different operations. A brow lift is designed to lift the eyebrows and the forehead. As we age, it is typical in many people to have the heavier eyebrow skin descend over the upper border of the eye socket leading to extra skin in the upper portion of the eye socket.</p><p>A blepharoplasty is performed by removing the extra skin in the eyelid itself. Eyebrow skin is a thicker heavier skin than the very thin eyelid skin. If you are considering eyelid surgery it is very important to consult a surgeon who has extensive experience with surgery in this area.</p><p>When evaluating a patient for a possible eyelid procedure, it is very important to first determine to what extent a sagging brow is contributing to their problem. It is possible that the best procedure may be a brow lift by itself, a blepharoplasty by itself, or a combination of the two.</p><p>If the eyebrows have descended to the point that they cause extra skin in this area, it is important to reposition the brow first and then determine how much extra eyelid skin is actually present. (John J. Edney, MD, Omaha Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Brow Lift vs. Eyelid Surgery</h3><p>The answer is that it depends on each patient’s anatomy. We have to evaluate the amount of excess upper-eyelid skin as well as the eyebrow position. In general, we first address extra skin of the upper eyelids with a blepharoplasty, often when patients are in their 30s through 50s. A forehead lift done too soon can create a surprised look. I usually reserve forehead lifts for patients who are a bit older, and usually perform them in conjunction with a facelift, or later on. (James N. Romanelli, MD, FACS, Long Island Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Both can bring great results!</h3><p>Do something right now. Take your two fingers in the mirror, look straight ahead, and raise your brow and if that satisfies your brow appearance goals you’ll also notice that it will take away some of the excess skin of your upper lid.</p><p>However if your eyebrow is in good position as it is in people of different ages it will make no impact on the excess skin of your upper lid. It will just raise your brow at a too high position. That decision will best occur in the consultation process.</p><p>The good thing about brow lifts and eyelid lifts is that they’re much more minimal recovery procedures.</p><p>An endoscopic brow lift procedure involves 3 small incisions in your scalp, it doesn’t involve shaving your hair, and you can shampoo the next day.</p><p>People love how they look in a refreshed way because often after an eyelid surgery (blepharoplasty) the hooding that’s in the lateral part of the brow still persists even after the excess skin is removed.</p><p>I wouldn’t say that a brow lift is better than an eyelid lift, it simply is a matter of accessing your priorities and blending that with the expertise of the surgeon and your expectations. (Paul Vanek, MD, Cleveland Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>When to do a Browlift rather than a Blepharoplasty</h3><p>A blepharoplasty will change the appearance of the eyes directly. A browlift, however, indirectly changes of appearance of the eyes, as well as address many other potential concerns.</p><p>So which procedure is appropriate depends on whether or not the patient would benefit and would like to benefit from getting some of the other changes obtained only with the brow lift.</p><p>These additional changes include,</p><ol>
<li>a smoother forehead,</li>
<li>a higher and more pleasant brow position at rest,</li>
<li>a softer more feminine position and shape to the brow,</li>
<li>smoothing and tightening of the “crow’s feet” area.</li>
</ol><p>There is often concern that raising the brows will make the person look “surprised” or somehow “different”. However, the trick is to never raise the brows higher than the patient tends to raise them in normal conversation. If you have “etched in” creases in your forehead, this means that you usually pull your eyebrows up during interactions with others and that this is how people are used to seeing you.</p><p>Raising the brows to this “usual” position, or at most a couple of millimeters more, ensures that the person doesn’t look “different” to others. They will then just look softer, more pleasantly energetic and youthful. By following these guidelines, I have never had a patient who was displeased with the results of a brow lift. Often, especially with significant hooding or excessive skin laxity that comes with age, the best and most natural and desirable look is achieved by doing a combination of both blepharoplasty and forehead lift. (Richard Parfitt, MD, Madison Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Browlift vs blepharoplasty – indications</h3><p>A browlift and blepharoplasty can both improve sagging eyelids. A blepharoplasty will remove excess hanging skin that is causing the sagging eyelids while a browlift raises the lowered brows that may be contributing to sagging eyelids. For most people a blepharoplasty is indicated more than a browlift.</p><p>However, they may be performed together if there is significant sagging that cannot be removed by blepharoplasty alone. Occasionally, the problem is due to a lowered brow by itself. (Kristina Tansavatdi, MD, Los Angeles Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Browlift vs blepharoplasty</h3><p>These are different procedures and accomplish different things. There is some overlap here though. Excess skin in the upper eyelid area is best treated by a removal of this skin (blepharoplasty).</p><p>Excess skin in the outer 1/3 of the eye may be significantly helped by a browlift (lateral hooding problem). Sometimes a combination of the two is needed for the best results (Richard Galitz, MD, FACS, Miami Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Brow lift and Blepharoplasty</h3><p>These 2 procedures performed separately or together will have an effect on your upper eyelid. The best analogy I could use is to imagine the brow as being the rod of a curtain and the upper eyelid sagging skin to be the actual curtain.</p><p>When the rod is lifted (the brow) the whole curtain (upper eyelid sagging skin) is moved upwards, which would result in lifting the sagging skin of the upper eyelid.</p><p>The ideal result achieved with a brow lift will elevate the lateral part of your brow and could improve some of the lateral hooding of the upper eyelid as well.</p><p>Both procedures if performed together should be performed by a specialist as this will require expertise to be able to balance forces and prevent not being able to close your eyes due to shortening of the upper eyelid skin and simultaneous elevation of the brow.</p><p>Make sure you do your research and find a well trained surgeon as this is an area that would require an expert in order to prevent complications. ( Jose Rodriguez-Feliz, MD , Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Browlift Vs Blepharoplasty – Which is Best for Sagging Eyelids?</h3><p>A blepharoplasty removes excess skin, and sometimes fat, from the upper eyelid. A brow lift elevates the eyebrow. Some patients may benefit from one or both procedures. Many patients who seek consultation for excess upper eyelid skin also need a brow lift. A brow lift elevates the eyebrows to place them into a more natural position.</p><p>In a woman the aesthetic eyebrow has a gentle arc and is peaked. The peak should be at the lateral limbus (the lateral border of the colored part of the eye) and be about 1cm above the orbital rim (edge of the bone at the top of the eye).</p><p>Your surgeon will help determine whether your eyebrows are in the appropriate position. If the eyebrow is in the correct position, then only in upper lid blepharoplasty is needed. If the eyebrow is too low, then a brow lift is performed to elevate the eyebrow.</p><p>Most patients who would benefit from a brow lift, also have excess upper lid skin and would also benefit from an upper lid blepharoplasty. A brow lift, in a patient who doesn’t need one, can make the person appear constantly surprised, unnatural, and can make the person’s upper-lid area appear hollow and aged.</p><p>Consultation with your surgeon will help determine which procedures will help you obtain your goals. ( Austin Hayes, MD , Portland Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Brow lift versus blepharoplasty</h3><p>I have performed less and less brow lifts over the years as I haven’t been satisfied with the results. When the brow is lifted surgically too often it leads to an unnatural, surprised appearance.</p><p>As a result I almost always recommend an upper bleph rather than a brow lift. While the upper lid surgery usually is enough, one can still opt for Botox treatments to lift the brow to achieve the most natural results possible. ( Katrinka L. Heher, MD , Boston Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Browlift Vs Blepharoplasty</h3><p>There is no definitive answer to your question without a physical examination and consultation. When you look at a mirror, would you mentally correct the problem by lifting the skin on your eyelid. If so, then you are most likely a candidate for blepharoplasty. If you would mentally lift up the entire brow, then you may want to consider a brow lift.</p><p>Most concerns regarding saggy or droopy eyelids can be addressed surgically with blepharoplasty or with a browlift. Consult with 3 experienced and expert board certified plastic surgeons to understand your options. ( Kris M. Reddy, MD, FACS , West Palm Beach Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
