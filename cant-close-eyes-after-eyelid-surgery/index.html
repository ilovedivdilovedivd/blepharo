<span itemprop="articleBody"><h3>Will I Be Able to Close my Eyes After blepharoplasty?</h3>
<p>The goal of any blepharoplasty should be to improve the appearance of the eyes without any compromise to the eyelid function.</p>
<p>An expert eyelid surgeon should know how not to remove too much skin or muscle.Â Therefore, the simple answer to your question is yes you should be able to close your eyes after blepharoplasty if done by a competent eyelid surgeon.</p>
<p>However, complications do occur rarely which theoreticall could result in poor eyelid closure. ( Sam Goldberger, MD , Beverly Hills Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Expect to close the eyes after a bleph.</h3>
<p>Certainly you should be able to close your eyes after having a bleph, If not to much skin has been removed and in some cases skin may need to be put back. ( Walter D. Gracia, MD , Fort Worth Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Avoid aggressive blepharoplasty to retain normal eye closure!</h3>
<p>When performing blepharoplasty on the upper eyelids, conservative skin marking should be performed to allow normal closure of the upper eyelids.</p>
<p>The decision to remove skin only, skin + muscle, skin + muscle + fat depends on many factors including age, ethnicity, and the degree of dermatochalasis and fat prolapse.</p>
<div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_661" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 210px"><a href="my-eyes-dont-close-after-lower-blepharoplasty/index.html" rel="attachment wp-att-661"><meta itemprop="width" content="200"><meta itemprop="height" content="150"><img itemprop="url" itemprop="image" class="size-medium wp-image-661" src="../wp-content/uploads/2015/08/My-eyes-dont-close-after-lower-blepharoplasty-200x150.jpg" alt="My eyes don't close after lower blepharoplasty" width="200" height="150" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">My eyes donât close after lower blepharoplasty</p></div>
<p>One shoe does not fit all. For lower lid blepharoplasty, a conservative approach should also be taken to prevent the development of lower eyelid retraction and incomplete closure of the eyelids.</p>
<p>In this case, lower eyelid tightening should be performed if there is laxity of the lid. Skin removal should be performed only judiciously and in conjunction with some type of lower eyelid retinacular support.</p>
<p>The consequences of incomplete eyelid closure include dry eye syndrome and even scarring of the cornea (clear part of eye). In general, it&#8217;s easy to remove more skin later but difficult to add! ( Bobby S. Korn, MD, PhD , San Diego Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Temporary incomplete eyelid closure can occur after blepharoplasty</h3>

<p>It is not uncommon for there to be a small amount of temporary incomplete eyelid closure (also called lagophthalmos) after upper lid blepharoplasty. The incomplete closure is due to swelling in the area and typically resolves after a week or so. You can apply ice packs, as directed by your surgeon, to the area to help with bringing down the swelling during the first few days of recovery, but otherwise it&#8217;s more of a matter of time.</p>
<p>It is important to keep your eyes lubricated (using artificial tears drops or ointment) if there is any lid lag to prevent your cornea from drying out. (Thomas A. Lamperti, MD , Seattle Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p>

<p>Lagophthalmos is the term for incomplete eyelid closure, which is not uncommon, temporarily, following blepharoplasty, particularly upper blepharoplasty, also known as blephaoplasty. Often minor lapophthalmos will resolve as the swelling recedes in one weeks&#8217; time following the procedure.</p>
<p>An experienced surgeon will check the integrity of the Bell&#8217;s reflex before surgery to ensure that, even if the eyelids don&#8217;t complete close in the days following surgery, the cornea will still be protected and moist and therefore less likely to dry and ulcerate. It is obviously important not to remove too much skin from the upper eyelids, but often times there is a narrow window between removing enough skin to get the desired result and removing too much and causing problems with eyelid closure.</p>
<p>When in doubt the prudent surgeon will err on the side of caution and remove less as it is always easier to remove a little more as a secondary procedure than to try to correct lagophthalmos due to excessive skin removal. For temporary lagophthalmos instruction on the use of drops and gels to keep the eyes moist is essential. ( Christopher J. Schaffer, MD , Birmingham Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Will I be able to close my eyes after eyelid surgery</h3>
<p>The answer is yes, if done correctly. Eyelid surgeons are trained to be very careful about how much skin is removed from the upper lids.</p>
<p>If too much skin is removed from upper or lower eyelids, there can be very bad complications with your eyes.Â The eyelids will not blink correctly, and the surface of your eyes will dry out and be very painful. Correction of this problem may require skin grafting.</p>
<p>Therefore I always tell patients that I will not remove every last millimeter of eyelid skin.</p>
<p>It is always better to have to go back and do a small touch up in the office to remove a little more skin (less than 5% incidence), than to face the complex reconstructive tasks of fixing up overdone surgery.</p>
<p>I often end up having some of these patients referred to me as an expert in eyelid surgery.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, even with our best efforts, sometimes patients are left better but still sorry they had the original procedure in these situations. Yoash R. Enzer, MD ( Yoash R. Enzer, MD, FACS , Providence Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Eyelids should be able to close after eyelid surgery</h3>
<p>The eyelids are important structures for protecting the cornea. Eyelids should be able to close completely after eyelid surgery. However, for a short time after surgery, due to swelling, it may be conceivable that they do not completely close for a short time, no more than a couple of days.</p>
<p>If they do not, still do not close, then you need to see your surgeon and corrective surgery may be needed. ( James Tang, MD , Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Yes, eyelids will close after surgery. Be patient.</h3>
<p>It is very common for the eyelids to not be able to fully close for 1 &#8211; 7 days after upper eyelid surgery. The lids may gap about 1 -2 mm. This is due to swelling and decresed strength of the muscles. As the tissues heal and relax the lids will come together.</p>
<p>During this time some eyedrops or ointments will keep the eyes comfortable. If the lids do not fully close, too much upper lid skin was removed. This should easily be avoided by careful preoperative marking of the skin with the lids open and closed, to accurately gauge what skin can be excised. ( Jeffrey M. Darrow, MD , Boston Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Yes, you absolutely will be able to close your eyes after eyelid surgery</h3>
<p>Absolutely! While you may have some early post-operative swelling that prevents you from fully closing your eyes for 1-2 days following the procedure, you should certainly be able to close your eyes completely thereafter. If you would like to be particularly aggressive with your eyelid surgery, there can occasionally be a fine line between taking just enough skin and too much.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, you should always be able to close your eyes after eyelid surgery, in order to protect your eyes from injury, maintain necessary moistness, and so your eyelids will look as natural as possible. Natural appearance is a very important goal that should be carefully considered when contemplating and planning for eyelid surgery. ( Michael R. Macdonald, MD, Bay Area Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Eye closure after Blepharoplasty</h3>
<p>Right after undergoing a Blepharoplasty your eyes should stay open by about 1 to 2mm upon closing your eyes. . if not, not enough skin was removed. DON&#8217;T force them to close them shut! That opening should last up to 2 weeks and will resolve. ( Henri P. Gaboriau, MD, Seattle Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>&#8220;Eyes wide-shut,&#8221; Eyelids should close after eyelid surgery.</h3>
<p>Immediately after upper or lower eyelid surgery (blepharoplasty), the eyes may have difficulty closing for a few days. This is due to swelling, anesthesia, and decreased eyelid muscle stregnth (orbicularis muscle) right after surgery.</p>
<p>However, once these all settle down (few days to a week) the eyes should be able to close without difficulty. Over aggressive surgery (removal of too much skin) can cause long term problems of eyelid closure leading to dry eyes, eye pain, and ocular decompensation requiring surgery to improve eyelid closure. ( Carlo Rob Bernardino, MD , Monterey Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p>
<p>Anxiety about blepharoplasty is very common. You want to make sure that your surgeon is experienced in cosmetic eyelid surgery. More importantly, you want to make sure that your surgeon knows how to fix a problem after it occurs.</p>
<p>It takes careful preoperative planning and accurate measurements to safely perform blepharoplasty and avoid complications. Just ask your surgeon lots of questions and make sure you are comfortable with them and their work. ( Manish H. Shah, MD, FACS , Denver Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Preventing removing too much skin in eyelid surgery</h3>
<p>The last thing one wants when undergoing a cosmetic procedure is to end up with a complication. In upper blepharoplasty, removing too much skin that results in the inability to fully close the eye should be avoided at all costs.Â I use a &#8220;pinch&#8221; technique to aid in marking the excess skin that determines the amount of skin that can be safely removed. If you are unable to close the eye fully after surgery it is usually temporary.</p>
<p>If it does not resolve then an additional procedure possible using a skin graft may be required to fix the problem. (Michael Baroody, MD, Danbury Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Closing you eyes after eyelid surgery, upper blepharoplasty</h3>
<p>Firt of all, an upper blepharoplasty, is, in my opine one of the best treatments to help you look more refreshed. I tell patients that if you are over the age of 30 and are looking to rejuvenate your face, then focus on the eye region and skin.</p>
<p>The upper Blepharoplasty take only 15-20 minutes and is performed under local anesthesia. It is marvelous! There is s single suture that is used to close the incision and this is removed at 5-6 days postoperatively. There is no pain. The blepharoplasty will last many years 15-20 years. So, this is clearly a wonder treatment, and like many, you are asking about the inability to close your eyes after the surgery. This is the greatest fear people have along with looking unnatural (ie Kenny Rogers.) These are mistakes that are made by marking and measuring the tissue to be excised inappropriately. This should never occur! In the hands of a well skilled Facial Plastic Surgeon, I think you would be thrilled. Always ask to speak to other patients. A Doctor should always be happy to provide patients to speak with regarding any treatment. ( Jon E. Mendelsohn, MD , Cincinnati Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>EYELID CLOSING AFTER blepharoplasty</h3>
<p>In most instances the inability to close the eyes (lagophthalmos) after blepharoplasty is temporary although in some instances this may be permanent. The risk of lagophthalmos becoming permanent is dependent on the type of upper blepharoplasty, blepharoplasty (removal of excess skin, a lid lift) or blepharoptosis repair (elevation of a droopy eyelid).</p>
<p>The risk is usually greater when a droopy eyelid is elevated because the space between the upper and lower eyelid is increased. Immediately following surgery lagophthalmos is common.</p>
<p>Artificial tears are used to help keep the eye, especially the cornea, moist to reduce light sensitivity, tearing, and discomfort.</p>
<p>After the anesthetic has worn off and the eyelid begins to stretch, the inability to close your eyes should improve over several days to weeks. In some instances lagophthalmos may be permanent but not result in noticeable symptoms or visual problems. In rare cases the eye may become dry and the use of artificial tears may be necessary on a permanent basis or additional surgery may be needed. ( Adam J. Cohen, MD , Skokie Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Closing eyelids after blepharoplasty</h3>
<p>After upper eyelid blepharoplasty, it may be difficult for you to close your eyes fro a few days, but this should resolve on its own.</p>
<p>Lower eyelid blepharoplasty usually does not cause problems with eyelid closure. ( Olivia Hutchinson, MD , New York Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Usual to have slight opening of eyelids for a 1-3 days</h3>
<p>When you do upper eyelids, it is very normal to have 1-3mm of lagophthalmos (inability to close eyes all the way) for 1-3 days. This goes away by itself. If too much skin is resected, it can be permanent ( Raghu Athre, MD , Houston Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Lids closure following blepharoplasty</h3>
<p>There is typically 1-2 mm of lagopthalmos following upper blepharoplasty surgery. This will resolve as swelling subsides in a week or two. Inability to completely close the eyes should not be a long term consequence of blepharoplasty. ( Jason R. Hess, MD , San Diego Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<p>Upper blepharoplasty can sometimes lead to difficulty closing the eye postoperatively. However, this should be temporary and resolve within 2-3 weeks. Keeping the eye moist with artificial tears and lube at night is important to avoid drying out the cornea. ( Etai Funk, MD , Houston Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Ability to close your eyes after eyelid surgery</h3>
<p>The patient&#8217;s ability to close eyes after eyelid surgery should not be compromised. It can happen if too much skin is removed.</p>
<p>In my opinion it is not optimal to remove maximum available skin and fat during eyelid surgery.</p>
<p>The hollow and tight look of eyelids after surgery can result if the surgeon removes too much tissue, in mistaken belief that that&#8217;s how a youthful look is achieved.</p>
<p>A talented and experience can create a natural and youthful look of the eyes without removing too much skin. (Boris M. Ackerman, MD, Newport Beach Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Closing your eyes after eyelid surgeries</h3>
<p>Closing the lids after surgery is dependent on the amount of surgery performed, the amount of swelling and the amount of skin resected.</p>
<p>You may not be able to close them fully but as you try to close them the eye rotates back in your head and protects the cornea even if the lid remains slightly open.</p>
<p>This is usually a transient issue and resolves quickly in almost all cases. ( Talmage J. Raine, MD, FACS , Champaign Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Temporarily complete closure may not occur</h3>
<p>Typically, even with careful skin removal, during the early period of recovery with swelling, there is often &#8220;lagopthalmos&#8221; meaning the eleids do not meet completely.</p>
<p>This usually will resolve after a few weeks. During that time it is important to protect the cornea from drying due to exposure, using lubricant drops and/or eye ointment as well as eye muscle exercises, massage and occasionally temporary taping of the eyelids especially at night.</p>
<p>Rarely, if too much skin is removed, the condition can be more chronic and may require a corrective surgery. ( David J. Levens, MD , Coral Springs Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Eyelid closure after blepharoplasty</h3>
<p>As long as your surgeon doesn&#8217;t remove too much skin, you will be able to close your eyes after blepharoplasty (eyelid surgery). There may be some initial swelling for the first few days which makes complete eyelid closure difficult, but after that, you should have full eyelid closure. You may need to use some eyedrops in the early post-operative recovery period to ensure that your eyes are kept moist if you are unable to fully close your eyes.</p>
<p>Please consult with a board certified plastic surgeon prior to scheduling a blepharoplasty. ( William Bruno, MD , Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Eyelid blepharoplasty surgery and eyelid closing</h3>
<p>One of the most feared complications of upper and lower eyelid surgery is inability to close the upper eyelids adequately (called lagophthalmos) and lowering of the lower eyelid so eyelid closure is also impaired (called lower eyelid malposition). Upper eyelid closure problems occur if too much skin is removed, if eyebrows are elevated too much at the same time as upper eyelid surgery, or both. It is normal to have a small gap between the eyelids after surgery (1-2 mm), but this should resolve as the swelling of surgery resolves.</p>
<p>If it does not, bring this to your doctor&#8217;s attention. While the eyelids are swollen, your doctor will prescribe artificial tears and lubricating ointments to insure that your eyes do not dry out and become irritated. ( Minas Constantinides, MD , Manhattan Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Closing eyes after eyelid surgery</h3>
<p>You should definitely be able to close your eyes after eyelid surgery. Immediately after surgery the eyes may not blink normally and the eyelids may not close fully. This will depend on what type of eyelid surgery you have Ptosis repair (droopy eyelid) vs. Blepharoplasty (removal of extra skin).</p>
<p>Either way, this usually resolves within a day or two and the eyes should close fully without any problem. ( David Freilich, MD , Englewood Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p>
<p>you should have no difficulty closing your eyes following your upper eyelid surgery after the expected swelling resolves. Of course, this depends on the surgeon removing an appropriate amount of skin.</p>
<p>An over zealous skin removal can result in an inability to close your eyes. If the correct measurements indicating the amount of skin to be removed are made this problem is totally avoidable. ( David A. Ross, MD , Austin Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Closing the eyes after eyelid surgery</h3>
<p>It is certainly critical that you be able to close your eyes completely following eyelid surgery, and because of this, I am very careful about the amount of skin that is removed so as not to create this problem.</p>
<p>Inability to close the eyes can result in dryness of the eye, which may require the use of lubricating eye drops.</p>
<p>It is not unusual, however, for this to occur on a temporary basis because of some post-surgical swelling that occurs.</p>
<p>In my experience, however, this has always been temporary and generally lasts no longer than one or two weeks. ( Ronald J. Edelson, MD , San Diego Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<p>The eyes are the windows to the soul. All too often, however, they seem to reveal exhaustion. The very delicate skin around the eyes tends to get crepey and puffy due to fatigue and stress. Eyelid surgery has become one of my most popular procedures.</p>
<p>If excess upper eyelid skin is hooding the eye and needs to be eliminated, an incision is made in the crease at the top of the lid and excess fat and skin are removed. The incisions are closed and sutured on the underside of the skin.</p>
<p>If undereye puffiness and dark circles need to be eliminated, an incision is made along the lower lashes that will be almost invisible when it heals.</p>
<p>Next, the fat below is either removed or redistributed and the saggy and crepey excess skin is then pulled up and cut off. The incisions is closed with tiny sutures, which are removed in four to six days.</p>
<p>The incisions are along your eyelash line, making it a virtually scarless procedure. Upon waking, you will need someone to take you home because the ointment in your eyes may blur your vision. After 3 days, you will no longer need the ointment, but you cannot wear contact lenses for another couple of weeks. To help minimize bruising, keep your head up postoperatively and ice.</p>
<p>Many patients prefer to wear dark sunglasses for a few days and take off at least one week from work. It is not uncommon to find that the eyes don&#8217;t close completely for a few days, but drops can ease the dryness. Another effective non-surgical option is Thermage, which can tighten the skin around the eyes.</p>
<p>Thermage is a non-invasive (no incision!) treatment that can tighten skin and stimulate your body to make healthier collagen the building block that provides structure to your skin. Fast and easy, Thermage requires no downtime from normal activities. ( Michelle Copeland, MD, DMD , New York Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Eyelid closure problems after surgery</h3>
<p>Immediately after surgery patients commonly have problems closing their eyes. This is because of two reasons 1. The new eyelid skin has tightening things significantly 2. The anesthetic interferes with eyelid closure. However within the next 48 hours, eyelid closure should improve tremendously.</p>
<p>Sometimes over the first month, patients can have temporary problems with eyelid closure and that usually resolves over the 1st month to two months.</p>
<p>Eyelid closure problems after that are uncommon and may be problematic. (Chris Thiagarajah, MD, Denver Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Eye closure after Eyelid Surgery or Blepharoplasty</h3>
<p>Most patients should be able to close their eyes after eyelid surgery. Occasionally the eyes may be slightly open immediate after surgery due to some swelling, but this resolves in the coming week. During this time it is important that you eyes do not dry out.</p>
<p>Often, patients can benefit from eyedrops to help them through the healing stages after eyelid surgery. The key to achieving safe and exceptional results of eyelid surgery is careful planning of your surgery. Careful measurements and markings prevent the removal of too much skin.</p>
<p>In addition, the older techniques of removing significant amounts of fat results in hollowed eyes that appear like cadavers. New techniques that focus on volume enhancement eye surgery create truly exceptional results. TO learn more, visit our website below. ( Ankit Desai, MD, Jacksonville Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Closing eyes after blepharoplasty</h3>
<p>You should definately be able to close your eyelids after blepharoplasty. Right after surgery, you may have swelling that keeps your lids from fully closing or opening, but that should be gone within 7-10 days.Â You are more likely to have swelling if you do both the upper and lower eyelids at the same time. It is very common to do them at the same time, however. ( Randy J. Buckspan, MD , Austin Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Eye Closure After Upper Blepharoplasty</h3>
<p>During upper blepharoplasty the surgeon walks a fine line between getting the best cosmetic result possible and avoiding post-operative dry eye. The wonderful upper eyelid of youth is the result of having very springy, spandex like skin in your upper eyelid.</p>
<p>Eyelid surgery doesn&#8217;t fix the eyelid by making it springy again, it does so by taking out extra skin, leaving behind less of the poorer quality skin and thus less of a flap. Because of loss of that spring in your skin, to get your eyes looking perfect when open, there may not be enough to close them.</p>
<p>So the surgery is a compromise. Not being able to close your eyes 100% after eyelid surgery in itself is not really a problem, it is the dry eye that can result that is the problem. It is not unusual to have your eyes be slightly cracked on gentle closure for the first days or perhaps weeks after surgery.</p>
<p>I see this frequently, and to date, it has resolved on every patient. It is important to follow proper care of your eye after surgery so that dry eye problems don&#8217;t ensue. The most important time to ensure eye lubrication is while you sleep.</p>
<p>An eye that is less than 1/16th of inch from closing the day after surgery on gentle closure should not alarm you. You should be able to close 100% with a little effort. If it is more than that, you need to work carefully with your doctor to determine the best route.</p>
<p>If you had preexisting dry eye or corneal disease, you should either not do the surgery, be more conservative, or realize that worsening of your eye issues is a distinct possibility. I have had a few patients with dry eye issues that lasted for several months after surgery.</p>
<p>Curiously, these patients easily closed their eyes 100%. I believe that in some individuals, the muslces around the eyes go extremely limp while sleeping allowing them to crack open.</p>
<p>This is actually not that uncommon even in people who have never had surgery. Eye lubrication at bedtime is the treatment until the problem resolves. ( Louis W. Apostolakis, MD , San Diego Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Eye Closure After Blepharoplasty</h3>
<p>You should definitely be able to close your eyes following a well performed blepharoplasty procedure. In most cases of blepharoplasty it matters more how much skin you leave behind rather than how much skin is actually removed. If a sufficient amount of skin is left intact after removing the excess, your eyelid should be able to cover the eye without problem.</p>
<p>In some blepharoplasty patients who have inherently laxity of their eyelid skin, some surgeons will remove a little more skin than average. This helps to compensate for the fact the remaining eyelid skin will stretch in the recovery process.</p>
<p>When too much skin has been removed and there is a permanent problem closing the eye, it is termed lagophthalmos. This is a potential complication that can result from excessively aggressive blepharoplasty surgery. Fortunately, in trained hands this is quite rare. ( John M. Hilinski, MD , Miami Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Closing your eyes after eye surgery</h3>
<p>If you can&#8217;t that&#8217;s a problem!! You should be able to close your eyes after a well performed eye surgery.</p>
<p>You may have a temporary problem closing while you are recovering, but it should subside with time. it is advisable to use artificial drops during that time until you recover. Good luck (Carlos Wolf, MD, Manhattan Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Closing Eyes After Eyelid Surgery</h3>
<p>Initially after the surgery you may have a slight gap in your eyelids that is usually discussed at the time of your surgical procedure based upon your age.</p>
<p>Most patients can close their eyes at the time of surgery and make a good water seal. Occasionally swelling in the immediate post-operative period is treated with eye ointments and drops.</p>
<p>Most patients routinely have normal eyelid closure from the time of their operation forward. ( Paul Vanek, MD , Cleveland Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Will I Be Able to Close my Eyes After Eyelid Surgery</h3>
<p>After surgery it is very common to have a small opening between your eyelids primarily due to swelling.</p>
<p>This will close within a day or so. In the meantime use artificial tear lubrication at night to protect your cornea. ( Paul Vitenas, Jr., MD , Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Closure of Eyelids After Surgery</h3>
<p>In general, one should be able to close your eyelids after surgery and certainly within the first week or so. ( Rod J. Rohrich, MD , Dallas Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<p>Immediately after surgery there will be initial swelling that may make it hard for some to completely close their eyes. However, after a few days the initial swelling should go down enough to start closing your eyes completely.</p>
<p>However, if swelling doesn&#8217;t subside enough to close your eyes within 1-3 weeks, then you should consult your doctor. It is also highly important this procedure is done by an experienced eyelid surgery doctor. &#8220;Dr.D&#8221; ( Edward E. Dickerson, IV, MD , Fayetteville Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Safety of upper eyelid surgery</h3>
<p>Properly performed upper eyelid surgery should cosmetically open your eyes, removing the tired appearance. However, you should absoluetely be able to close your eyes after upper eyelid surgery.</p>
<p>It is important to seek a surgeon with experience in performing this surgery, see before and after photos of patients, and ask questions. ( Sandy Sule, MD , Dallas Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<p>If eyelid surgery is performed by a qualified surgeon and is a good technician your eyes should properly after surgery without any difficulty. If you are having difficulty closing your eyes visit your surgeon, so that he can help you prevent dry eye syndrome. ( David Alessi, MD , Beverly Hills Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Can I close my eyes after eyelid surgery?</h3>
<p>No, you will be able to open and close your eyelids after eyelid surgery. It may be slightly more difficult initially due to swelling of the eyelids but should not prevent you from being able to fully open or close your eyes. ( Robert Heck, MD , Columbus Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Open eyes after eyelid surgery</h3>
<p>it can be common for a few days after an upper lid blepharoplasty, for the eyelid to not totally close when lying down. This is usually due to swelling and gets better in time. The eyelids are very thin and even a small amount of surgery can cause things such as this.</p>
<p>During that time period, saline eye drops are sometimes used to keep the eyes moist, but in the vast majority of cases, the swelling goes down in a week or two and the eyes close much more easily. ( Julio Garcia, MD , Las Vegas Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Closing eyes after eyelid surgery</h3>
<p>After upper eyelid surgery, it is not unusual to have difficulty approximating the eyelids for the first few days because of the swelling associated with the procedure. It is important to keep your eyes moist during this period with appropriate eye lubricants.</p>
<p>For lower eyelid procedures, it is uncommon to have this problem unless there is laxity of the lid. Most surgeons perform ancillary procedures to tighten the lower lids when a patient is at greater risk. ( Joseph N. Togba, MD , Oakland Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Due to the swelling, initially they will be partially open</h3>
<p>You will be able to close your eyes, nonetheless, due to excessive swelling from the procedure your ability to fully close them may be prevented by the swelling. You will be able to fall asleep but someone else may notice your eyelids are partially opened.</p>
<p>They can be gently closed with a clean hand, but the swelling should go away in a few days and then you should be able to close your eyes completely. It is important to use eye lubrication and follow up with your surgeon. ( Yael Halaas, MD , Manhattan Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p>
<h3>Ability to close your eyes after eyelid surgery</h3>
<p>The vast majority of the time patients do not have any trouble closing their eyelids after eyelid surgery. On some occasions swelling can make it difficult to fully close the eyelids. This condition, called lagophthalmos, will resolve once the swelling goes down. However, this can cause the eyes to become dry and irritated.</p>
<p>Therefore, during this time I encourage my patients to keep their eyes moist during the day with over the counter eye drops and to use ointment in their eyes when they go to sleep. I also encourage my patient to keep their head elevated when they are sleeping so that gravity can help the swelling go down sooner. ( M. Keith Hanna, MD , Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p>
