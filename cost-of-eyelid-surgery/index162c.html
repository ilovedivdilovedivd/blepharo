<div overflow></div></amp-ad><div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><h3>The Average Physician Fee for eyelid surgery is $2,724.00</h3><p>Eyelid surgery (blepharoplasty) is a very rewarding procedure for properly selected patients. When properly performed, eyelid surgery will give a more youthful alert appearance to the patient.</p><p>The cost for this procedure varies from doctor to doctor and geographic location to geographic location. Recent statistics published by the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery report that the average physician fee for this procedure is $2,724.</p><p>This fee does not include the fee that will be charged by the facility in which you have this procedure. Additionally, if an anesthesiologist is required there will be another fee.</p><p>If the upper eyelids are operated on only or if the lower eyelids are operated on only, one would expect the fee to be close to the same for each individual procedure.</p><p>Normally, the surgeon’s fee includes all of the post-operative care associated with the procedure. When two or more procedures are performed at the same time, the overall cost is less expensive.</p><p>This is due to the fact that the first hour of surgery requires the opening of all of the instruments and other items necessary for the procedure.</p><p>Subsequent operations performed at the same time do not include this initial fee. For these reasons, upper and lower eyelid surgery performed at the same time is less expensive than it would be if these two procedures were separated and done at different times (John J. Edney, MD, Omaha Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Blepharoplasty cost</h3><p>In Cincinnati the price for upper/lower blepharoplasties in office averages about $3500-$5500. Most can be done in office under local anesthesia. (Kurtis Martin, MD, Cincinnati Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Eyelid surgery cost</h3><p>The cost of lower eyelid surgery is usually more expensive than upper eyelid surgery. Combining the two procedures also brings down the rate for each individual procedure.</p><p>The rates depend on whether the procedure is done under local anesthesia or sedation or general anesthesia. Upper blepharoplasty can be comfortably done under local anesthesia and costs in the Los Angeles area varies from $2000 to $3000.</p><p>With the use of general anesthesia the cost varies from $3300 to $4500. Lower blepharoplasty is usually performed under sedation or with general anesthesia and costs $3500 to $5000. (Kristina Tansavatdi, MD, Los Angeles Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>What is the cost of an eyelid lift?</h3><p>The cost of doing the upper and lower eyelid surgery should be the last factor in deciding who to go to for eyelid surgery. Your eyes are the most impotant part of your body and their appearace and function are extremely critical to your health and beauty. The lower eyelid surgery is more delicate and chalenging than the upper lid, therefore it is more expensive. You might also require lower lid tightening which adds to the complexity of the operation. In my hands and after 30 years of experience the upper and lower lids range between 5000 to 6000 $ depending on what needs to be done. I perform the procedure under local anesthesia with mild sedation. (Farhad Rafizadeh, MD, Morristown Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Eyelid Surgery Ranges Between $3,000-$3,500 in the Midwestern, US</h3><p>The cost of eyelid surgery varies significantly and is dependent upon a multitude of variables. It’s important to understand these variables and how they contribute to any fee quote that you may receive.</p><p>For instance, does the fee quote include the surgeon’s fee, facility fee, and anesthesia charges or just the surgeon’s fee? Does the fee quote include local or general anesthesia? These are just a few of the questions that need to be answered before proceeding.</p><p>It’s important to make sure that your fee quote includes the surgeon’s fee, facility fee, anesthesia charges and pre and post-operative care. Generally, surgeons who operate in dedicated outpatient cosmetic surgery facilities are able to offer lower facility fees than those who operate in hospital based practices. The surgeon’s fee can vary as well depending on regional differences and levels of local competition. Anesthesia fees can vary and this may be related to the use a nurse anesthetist verses a physician anesthesiologist. Also the type of anesthesia may contribute to fee differences. General anesthesia is more expensive than local anesthesia. When all of these variables are considered, fees in the Midwestern United States for upper and lower eyelid surgery performed together range from $4000 to $5000. When either lower or upper lid eyelid surgery is performed separately the fees range from $3000 to $3500. These fees would include general anesthesia. It’s important to remember that although price is an important component of your decision, it’s not the only consideration. It’s also important to be comfortable with your surgeons experience and reputation. (Richard J. Bruneteau, MD, Omaha Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>How much does blepharoplasty surgery cost?</h3><p>This varies greatly depending on the speciality, geographic location and whether you need to have surgery in an operating room with an anesthesiologist.</p><p>If you are having the lids done combined with other procedures there frequently is some discounting. I would be wary of too good a deal, because you usually get what you pay for.</p><p>As an oculoplastic surgeon, I believe our prices are a bit more expensive as we have the most experience with this procedure than any other specialty. (Katrinka L. Heher, MD, Boston Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Cost of Eyelid surgery</h3><p>The price of surgery does vary greatly depending on what procedure(s) you may need. These costs will also differ from doctor to doctor, and varies on your location.</p><p>However, please do not select the surgeon based on cost. This is a very meticulous surgery and you should want a surgeon with experise and your aesthetics. Consult a qualified facial plastic/ plastic surgeon. (James Shire, MD, Chattanooga Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Eye lid suegery in Tijuana Mexico</h3><p>Our practice we have perform over 1,500 face lifts in the last 16 years, most of this patients we also do eye lid surgery.80% of my patients we correct the droopy upper eyelid by just doing a brow lift!I ask my patients to go back and take a look at a photo in there 20’s and evaluate the position on there brows.</p><p>If they us to be higher Bingo! we just re position the brow with a minimal incision (also correct the lines across the forehead frown lines and heaps with crows feet!). If my patient had a heavy upper eye lid in there 20’s, we perform upper eye lid surgery focosing more in fat removal in the corner to get more open distance betwen the corner of the eye and the brow (girls like to have more room to apply cosmetics right!).</p><p>Lower eyelid is diferent: depends on the problem : exces of skin, redundant muscle, fat herniation, of laxity on the traso! so every patient is carefull evalauted to get the rigth surgcal plan! Brow lift $2,500, upper eye lid $1,500, lower eye lid $1,500 Looking forward to evaluate your case and take great care of you. (Manuel Gutierrez Romero, MD, Mexico Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Blepharoplasty surgery cost in Atlanta</h3><p>Blepharoplasty surgery cost varies for a number of reasons. Cost is based on the amount of work that has to be done, the difficulty level of the surgery, the experience of the surgeon, the revision rate of the surgeon, the surgeon’s credentials and training, the city the surgery will be performed in, and history of previous surgery.</p><p>Upper eyelid surgery and lower eyelid surgery are usually the same cost but sometimes upper blepharoplasty surgery can be less expensive. Cost in atlanta varies from $2500-$5000 for one set of eyelids, meaning upper or lower eyelids (not including anesthesia or facility costs).</p><p>Cost really should be the least important factor when considering surgery on your face, but for some, I understand this is the most important. Know that there are financing options available and using this to your advantage will help you find a good surgeon that can give you an excellent result. You may have to pay more up front but it will save you money and time from having to redo your surgery from an inexperienced, yet inexpensive, surgeon. (Mike Majmundar, MD, Atlanta Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Cost of blepharoplasty surgery , Connecticut</h3><p>When choosing a plastic surgeon, I wouldn’t suggest going for the best deal and instead look at their before and afters photos and credentials. Looking for a board certified plastic surgeon with years of experience and someone you have a good rapport with. Eye lid surgery known as blepharoplasty is preformed on the either the upper or lower eye lids or both. Prices usually range depending on location, skill of the surgeon and surgical fees, such as, OR and anesthesia. Cost of blepharoplasty lift plastic surgery, connecticut: $3000-$6000 depending on the procedure and the amount of time needed in the OR and anesthesia. (Alfred Sofer, MD, FACS, Fairfield Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Eyelid surgery costs</h3><p>Eyelid surgery, formally known as blepharoplasty, is a procedure requiring precision and attention to detail. Price alone should not determine who you choose as your surgeon. Make sure you discuss your concerns with a board certified plastic surgeon who has experience in eyelid surgery.</p><p>I have set fees for upper and lower eyelids and will discount the procedure fees if both upper and lower eyelids need correction at the same operative session. There are also surgicenter fees which should be disclosed. (Andrew Goldberg, MD, San Diego Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Upper eyelid surgery cost can range from $1800-$3500 depending on whether you will need general anesthesia or just local anesthesia. The cost is less if done in the office without general anesthesia but it is not for all patients. Upper and lower eyelid surgery can cost $4000-$5000. This includes surgeon’s fee, facility fee and anesthesia fee. (Kyle S. Choe, MD, Virginia Beach Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Eyelid surgery costs</h3><p>Blepharoplasty costs varies depending on the concern being addressed. It can be as simple as pinching out a small amount of skin or as complex as reconstructing the support to the lower lid to prevent eversion from the tightening.</p><p>It may also involve upper lid ptosis repair. Lower lid surgery commonly involves fat repositioning and in most cases is more complex than upper lid surgery. Finally, the cost will depend on the type of anesthesia involved.</p><p>If it is performed under local or oral sedation, you will likely not have to pay for the service of an anesthesiologist. If it is under general, this will increase the price. My surgeon’s fee is generally $2000 to $4000 depending on the complexity of the case. (Sirius K. Yoo, MD, Toronto Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Blepharoplasty Costs</h3><p>The fees for upper eyelid and lower eyelid blepharoplasty: The procedure takes about one hour</p><ul>
<li>Professional fee: $3000</li>
<li>Medicare approved Facility fee: $1000</li>
<li>Anesthesia MD/DO Fee: $600</li>
<li>Total ~ $4600</li>
</ul><p>Consult with a Board Certified Plastic SurgeonBest Wishes (George C. Peck, Jr, MD, West Orange Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>costs of Eyelid Surgery in Las Vegas</h3><p>Upper or lower blepharoplasty starts at $3500 and $6000 for full upper & lower eyelid.A thorough examination, by a Board Certified Plastic Surgeon is necessary to provide a more accurate price. (Arthur M. Cambeiro, MD, Omaha Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Eyelid Surgery Costs in the Midwest, US.</h3><p>As with any cosmetic surgery, the costs of blepharoplasty will differ from one surgeon to another and from one area of the country to another. Difference also exist depending on which regions require attention. Typically, if it is only the upper eyelids or only the lower eyelids, the cost will be the same.</p><p>If both the upper and lower eyelids are done together then there is a built in discount since you are paying only once for facility and for the anesthesia fees. Also, usually the surgeon will discount the fees on the secondary procedure when two or more are combined.</p><p>At our private Midwestern plastic surgical practice and in our own accredited surgical facility, the cost for either bilateral upper or bilateral lower eyelid blepharoplasty is $3100.</p><p>If upper and lower eyelids are done together then the fee is $4200. This includes the surgeon’s fee, the facility fee and anesthesia. The only out of pocket expenses that you may incur would be for any dressing supplies (ie gauze, sponges) and prescriptions.</p><p>These tend to run approximately $60. Also, sometimes insurance will cover the prescriptions even though they do not cover the surgery. (Marie E. Montag, MD, )</p><h3>Cost of Eye Lid Surgery in Newburgh, New York</h3><p>Eye lid surgery cost varies and depends on a few factors. Facility fees and anesthesia if needed are extra.A. Upper Eye lid surgery. $ 2200B. Lower Eye lid Surgery. 2500 to 50001. Traditional lower eye lid surgery $ 25002. Transonjunctival lower eye lid surgery with laser resurfacing $ 3,0003.
