If they’re performed separately, it does not matter which one comes first. (William Portuese, MD, Seattle Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Both surgeries are very powerful in their ability to improve the facial appearance. Personally, I think doing this work in a staged fashion is a very good thing to do.</p><p>Surgeon always want to do the blue plate special to encourage you to have as much surgery at once as possible.</p><p>I often have to fix the consequences of that. The key is to have the surgery you need now and hold off on the surgery that is not immediately necessary. An objective assessment of your face and your personal concerns that takes into consideration your budget will likely get you to the right place.</p><p>Remember, this is your face we are taking about. Finding the best deal is not nearly as important as getting the work right. The cheapest surgeon is seldom going to be the best surgeon. (Kenneth D. Steinsapir, MD, Beverly Hills Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>When you can only do one procedure</b></p><p>You must decide on what procedure will give you more bang for the buck. As for lid surgery, it can safely be done in the office under local to save you considerable amounts. Some surgeons provide multi-procedure discounts so ask yours if you can get that and have your lids done in the office.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_100190" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Finally, you can shop around for better prices that may better fit your budget. Some doctors will ‘beat’ other fees so you can inquire about that too. (Curtis Wong, MD, Redding Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>You will likely get the biggest bang for your buck and greatest reduction in apparent age with the facelift procedure. You may save money in the long run if you undergo eyelid surgery combined with the facelift at the same operation.</p><p>The reason is that there is usually an upfront fee to go to surgery and you would avoid this initial surgery cost the second go-around if you were able to complete all surgeries in one the first time. (Bryson G. Richards, MD, Las Vegas Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Blepharoplasty or facelift</h3><p>In general, either can be done first. Typically, priority is given to the area that concerns you most. Occasionally there can be a reason that one surgery should be performed before the other.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_100191" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-a02e3536d677ec7abba3c40f82b44f46">

</div><p>This is something to discuss at your consultation. (Ira Vidor, MD, Newport Beach Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Eyelid surgery or facelift</i></p><p>A blepharoplasty will cost much less than $10,000. If you combine both it will be a little more. It really depends on what bothers you the most. Most people need their eyelids done at a younger age than a facelift, but 52 is also a reasonable age for a facelift as well</p><p>The decision really is up to you taking all factors, including cost, into consideration.</p><p><i>Timing of Eyelid and Facelift procedures</i></p><p>It is all a matter of what bothers you the most. Please note that there is a saving in doing both procedures at once – only one Operating Room and anesthesia if required charge, only one recovery period so less time off work, etc</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_100192" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>many patients either have two different Surgeons do their surgeries or they space their surgeries apart for various reasons. There is no specific timeline to follow – the best thing to do would be to let both Surgeons know your plans so they can best advise you as to how to proceed</p><p>This is important because there are different ways of doing eye surgery and facelifts (in terms of approach and technique used, amount of postop swelling, healing time needed, etc). This way your Surgeons can coordinate your care so that you have the best results and easiest recovery possible</p><h5>Eyelid or Facial surgery on limited money expenditure</h5><p>You may have to make this decision for yourself, unfortunately. Each procedure accomplishes different things, with distinct benefits.for you. The eyes are a highly focused area for attention facially as we look at one another</p><p>If there is a limitation on what may be spent for facial surgery, perhaps the eyelid surgery may be a priority. If you believe your neck and jowls and face may be more of an area for aging as you see yourself, then clearly the facial surgery should become a priority</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_100193" class="wp-caption alignleft amp-wp-inline-83e6c35ef7b5f8984a37bb8ce108c0bb">

</div><p>Having been in practice for many years I have always let the patient guide the decision process in facial surgery. This may be one of those times again.</p><p><em>I believe that priority must always be given to the eyes and the eyelids that surround them.</em></p><p>I believe that in our North American culture, most interpersonal interaction involves eye contact. As a result, the eyes are most commonly the focus of attention in any direct communication. For this reason, I believe that priority must always be given to the eyes and the eyelids that surround them</p><p>Fortunately, treatment of aging eyelids is also generally less expensive, so you will be well within your $10k budget range.</p><h3>Depends on your presenting anatomy</h3><p>It all depends on the presenting anatomy as to whether or not a blepharoplasty or facelift is needed at age 52. Some patients are not ready yet at that age. It really depends upon what the patient’s needs, goals, and desires are, and it is important to make sure that the surgeon can deliver on those results</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_100194" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>It is less expensive to have both procedures performed together than separately because of the cost of the operating room and anesthesia. The other factor to consider is the bruising and swelling, which lasts two weeks for the eyelids and two weeks for the facelift</p><p>If done separately, it would be four weeks of recovery time rather than two weeks if they were done together.</p><p><i>Eyelid or Facelift Surgery </i></p><p>I suggest you do the following:</p><ol>
<li>Find a good surgeon you trust.</li>
<li>Determine what bothers you the most.</li>
<li>If possible,it is always best to do both at the same time.</li>
<li>If finances are a consideration, which they are for most of us, you will select the surgery that meets your immediate needs or save enough money to do both at the same time</li>

</div><p>All this should be done with the assistance of your physician.</p><p><em>Timing of facial rejuvenation procedures</em></p><p>This is a great question and very commonly asked. Generally speaking, you should target that aspect of your face that bothers you most when dealing with limited resources. Try to get the best “bang for your buck” so to speak</p><p>It may be that rejuvenating the upper 1/3 of your face (upper/lower blepharoplasty + browlift) now will make you quite happy and fit your current budget. The lower 2/3 (facelift including neck with fat transfer) can wait until you and your pocket book are ready</p><p>If money were no option, it makes complete sense anatomically to perform facial rejuvenation in its entirety at one sitting. One surgery, one anesthesia, one recovery typically produces a great result. But regardless of what we all say, this is a highly personal decision that only you and your surgeon can make</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_100196" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-a02e3536d677ec7abba3c40f82b44f46">

</div><p>No one can argue with doing little things along the way and achieving a piecemeal rejuvenation, providing it is done well and looks natural.</p><p><strong>Eyelids vs facelift</strong></p><p>Limited resources can certainly put a crimp in your desire to have facial rejuvenation. As to which one will give you the msot bang for your buck, it really depends upon what bothers you the most</p><h5>Should I do my eyelids or my facelift first?</h5><p>If you find a surgeon you trust, as all the other doctors have mentioned, that is step one. Then, identify which portion of your face bothers you the most. If both the face and the eyes are just as important, then you should consider the cost of both procedures and find a way to wait and save for the treatment</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_100197" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-a02e3536d677ec7abba3c40f82b44f46">

</div><p>The other alternative is to obtain financing from companies like CareCredit. However, keep in mind that no one wants you to put all your available money into this procedure. You should make sure that other financial aspects of your life are in order</p><p>Then, and only then, should you plan for this procedure. Don’t simply shop on price alone!</p><p>You could possibly get both of the procedures done at the same time which would be the most cost effective approach. However, you definitely want to consider other things such as your health, length of time in OR which increases your risks, recovery, etc</p><p>Don’t let the cost of the procedure pursuade you in one direction. Ultimately, you want to improve what bothers you so don’t compromise results for cash. Figure out exactly what you don’t like, have a consultation with a board certified plastic surgeon, one that specializes in facial procedures would be best, and go from there</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_100198" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-5729eadb6841f812a47a108d82e9cd34">

</div><p>It may not take both procedures to achieve the look you want. Sometimes just have the eyes done can make a huge difference in your appearance. Again, your surgeon will be able to recommend what is best given your anatomy</p><h4>Do what you can afford</h4><p>I would definately do what you can afford. It is alway better to do the eyes at the same time as the face. The reason is doing multiple procedures usually you save money on the operating room and anesthesia fees rather than having to come back to do a second surgery</p><p>Having said that, if you can not do it financially and prefer to wait then you should do what is best for you.</p><h3>Face lift first</h3><p>I would suggest face lift first and then blepharoplasty. Possibly, your surgeon will give you a discount to do a blepharoplasty at the same time. (Pierre Guibor, MD, New Jersey Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_100199" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p><strong>Aging face</strong></p><p>Connective tissue disorders can certainly make you age faster than normal, leading to more wrinkles, due to the decreased collagen production as you alluded to. Some disorders are safe to operate on, and others are not.</p><p>So, I’d suggest doing nonsurgical treatments for now, including laser and fat grafting, but again it would depend on the type of disorder, as your collagen production is likely to be faulty. Sorry. Would need to know specifics before answering further. (Cain R. Linville, MD, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Lower Eyelid Treatment</h3><p>It appears part of the issue is volume loss of the lower eyelids and fine lines. I would not recommend fat removal (such as with lower eyelid blepharoplasty) since that would accentuate the hollowed-out appearance.</p><p>A CO2 laser treatment for skin resurfacing would work well for the fine lines. You could also consider tear trough filler to smooth out the lines and add volume to the lower eyelids to get rid of the creasing.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_100200" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-c7b3e0b9854ed013c1592278f6f706f4">

(Mahsa Sohrab, MD, New Haven Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p><p>Blepharoplasty, or eyelid surgery, can remove the fatty deposits in your upper eyelid, tighten any sagging skin and remove excess skin and wrinkles that developed around your lower eyelid. I suggest that you consult with a board certified facial plastic surgeon.</p><p>The consultation will allow you to explore the blepharoplasty in greater depth through an in-person examination as well as the chemical peel. (Ross A. Clevens, MD, Melbourne Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>ou have brow asymmetry and with that some asymmetry of the eyelid folds, which would not be fully corrected by upper blepharoplasty alone.</p><p>Although it is true that there are many overdone upper eyes, obvious in some celebrities, a well-done upper blepharoplasty with removal of an appropriately small amount of skin, and in your case no fat, would look very natural.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_100201" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>In an experienced surgeon’s hands, there is very little risk to removing a small amount of skin. Brow asymmetry is very common and could be improved with a brow lift, but again a conservative approach would be appropriate.</p><p><i>Upper blepharoplasty at time do facelift</i></p><p>You have some degree of ptosis or drooping of your upper lids. This can certainly be repaired at the same time as a lower facelift. This should not be viewed as medical advice, since only an examination in person can determine what is needed. (Paul W. Loewenstein, MD, Milwaukee Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>General anesthesia concerns.</em></p><p>General anesthesia is very safe. Improved medications, monitoring and techniques have made it safer than driving your car. Especially here in San Francisco!If you are healthy, without major medical problems, your risk is minimal and comparable to a deep sedative.</p><p>My suggestions is to discuss your options and concerns with the anesthesiologist before your surgery. It will put you at ease and allow you to make better decisions about your care (Kenneth Bermudez, MD, San Francisco Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
