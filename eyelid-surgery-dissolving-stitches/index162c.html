Some dissolve within a couple of days, some dissolve over a few weeks.</p><p>The rate that these stitches dissolve also depend on the individual patient. Because of the variability of dissolvable sutures, I generally never use them on eyelids.</p><p>I find it more reliable to use non dissolvable sutures in the eyelids that are removed in three to five days. The healing is more reliable and there is generally less scarring.</p><p>It is almost completely painless to remove the stitches. ( James Tang, MD, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Absorbable sutures for upper eyelid surgery</h3><p>Absorbable sutures can sometimes take longer than expected to dissolve. 1% hydrogen peroxide will hasten this process for some types of sutures and is worth a try.</p><p>Any remaining sutures should be removed by your surgeon to prevent suture marks. ( Anand D. Patel, MD , Brookfield Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Ideally the sutures used for the eyelid surgery will dissolve within 5-10 days; however, the knots may take longer than the rest of the suture. In this case, your doctor can remove them. Usually this is not necessary, by gently massaging the antibiotic ointment over the area, and applying warm compresses as needed, most patients do not need anything further. ( Elliot M. Heller, MD , New York Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Suture material</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_492" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>The precise amount of time depends on the exact suture type. The type of suture I use in this area is fast absorbing plain gut which usually takes 1-2 weeks to absorb. I would ask your plastic surgeon what kind of suture material was used and then you can search this via the web or ask your plastic surgeon. ( Chad Douglas Tattini, MD , Bloomington Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Dissolving sutures and eyelid surgery</h3><p>The time that it takes for skin sutures to dissolve depends on the type and the thickness of the suture. The most commonly used sutures can take 5 – 30 days to fully dissolve. I prefer to use non-dissolving sutures for the upper and lower eyelid skin because I feel that it gives a better cosmetic result. If I use a dissolving suture, then I will remove any remaining suture in 1 or 2 weeks. ( Melanie Ho Erb, MD, Santa Monica Oculoplastic Surgeon</p><h3>Dissolving sutures and blepharoplasty surgery</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_491" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>The speed at which sutures dissolve depends on the material they are made from, and their thickness. Some sutures start to dissolve within a week, others can take weeks to months. Surgeons can choose the speed they want, depending on the needs of the particular repair. For eyelid sutures, usually we just want a material that holds for the first week, and then goes away. Unfortunately, sometimes the sutures don’t always dissolve when we want them to.so sometimes we end up removing them at a post-operative visit anyway! Check with your surgeon to see if your sutures are ready to be removed. (Thomas Fiala, MD, Fort Lauderdale Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Dissolvable sutures after eyelid surgery</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_493" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>There are many different types of absorbable sutures, so their rate of absorption really varies. However, for your sutures, my guess is that they will start to dissolve within 5 days. It could still take a couple of weeks for them to fully dissolve. Other sutures that are used deep can take months to dissolve, but they are not routinely used for the skin closure. (Ryan Greene, MD, PhD, Seattle Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Different sutures, different dissolve rates.</h3><p>There are various dissolvable stitches on the market and it depends upon what type of sutures were used. Certain dissolvable sutures (ie, fast absorbing gut) are typically used on the skin’s surface and dissolve within 7-10 days while other sutures are applied beneath the surface of the skin (ie, vicryl) and can take up to 3 months to dissolve. (Peter Schmid, DO, Longmont Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Dissolving sutures and when they disappear.</h3><p>Dissolving or absorbable suture are made of various material which are designed to hydrolyze and breakdown over a set period of time. Some are designed to breakdown with in 3-5 days whereas other may take as long as 2 weeks. Advantages are not needing to have them removed, whereas disadvantages include variability when they dissolve (too early or too late).</p><p>Warm compresses as well as keeping sutures moist with ointment often help breakdown, or if they don’t breakdown they can be removed by your surgeon. (Carlo Rob Bernardino, MD, Monterey Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Sutures in eyelid surgery</h3><p>If absorbable sutures are used they typically dissolve anywhere between 5 to 12 days. For the lower eyelids I usually use absorbable sutures.</p><p>For the upper eyelids non absorables are used because they heal much better in this area. (Kami K. Parsa, MD, Los Angeles Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Stitches/Sutures rate of dissolving in Eyelid Procedures</h3><p>Typically the sutures that are used in the upper eyelid are removed regardless of whether or not they are “dissolveable”</p><p>The reason for this is because dissolvable sutures dont predictably dissolve at a set time. There is a range of times that sutures do dissolve, but we prefer to remove the sutures by day 6 for eyelid surgeries.</p><p>The dissolvable sutures in the lower eyelid area typically can be removed even sooner (day 4 or day 5.) (Jon E. Mendelsohn, MD, Cincinnati Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Sutures take different times to dissolve</h3><p>There are many different types of dissolvable sutures that are used in plastic surgery. The time that it takes for the suture to dissolve is dependent on that type of suture. Some sutures can dissolve in as quick as 3 to 5 days. These type of sutures are usually used for closing the skin. Other types of sutures can take 6 to 7 months to dissolve. An example of this type of suture is utilized to close the deep tissues on an abdominoplasty. Therefore, the answer to your question is that the time taken for various sutures does is to dissolve is dependent on the type of suture. (Raghu Athre, MD, Houston Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>How long for blepharoplasty sutures to dissolve?</h3><p>There are many different types of materials used for stitches (sutures) for closing the skin. Some are absorbable and some are permanent and need to be removed. Typically, the type of sutures used for eyelid surgery (blepharoplasty) that are visible on top of the skin and absorbable take anywhere from 5-10 days to dissolve.</p><p>Any longer, and these may leave railroad track scars along the incision. I typically remove non-absorbable sutures after blepharoplasty at 5 days. (Etai Funk, MD, Houston Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>How long until plastic surgery blepharoplasty sutures dissolve?</h3><p>There are different approaches to closing blepharoplasty incisions. If dissolvable sutures were used, then they usually dissolve in anywhere from 5 to 14 days, depending on the exact type of material used and the patients ability to dissolve the sutures.</p><p>Often they dissolve internally but are “stuck” to the skin externally and seem intact. Using ointment on the sutures and cleaning the wound helps prevent this. (Sam Goldberger, MD, Beverly Hills Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Time for eyelid stitches to dissapear</h3><p>Depending on what type of blepharoplasty sutures are used they should dissolve between 7 and 10 days. Using some antibiotic ointment often helps them disappear.</p><p>I prefer not to use absorbable stitches as they may create more irritation. Itake out my stitches in three days and keep steri-strips on my patients eyes. (Carlos Wolf, MD, Miami Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Eyelid stitiches take time to dissolve</h3><p>Dissolving sutures can take 3 days to 3 months, depending upon what type of material the sutures are made of. If they are on the outside, only the portion under the skin dissolves, so you may continue to see remnants on the surface. Your doctor can answer the question precisely. If they are not bothering you, then just enjoy your new eyelids! (Randy J. Buckspan, MD, Austin Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Sutures in eyelid surgery</h3><p>I recommend removal of all sutures in eyelid surgery. Not removing sutures that can dissolve can lead to more scarring as they cause more reaction during the healing period. ( Kurtis Martin, MD , Cincinnati Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Dissolvable sutures for eyelid surgery</h3><p>For upper eyelid surgery, most surgeons use non-dissolving sutures since this usually heals better in the area with less reaction to the suture material. The eyelid incision, however, heals very well and dissolvable sutures usually take anywhere from 5-14 days depending on the material used.</p><p>If the sutures get wet or ointment is used over the incision, the sutures will dissolve faster. ( Kristina Tansavatdi, MD , Los Angeles Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Sutures</h3><p>It depends on the type of absorbable suture. SOme will dissolve after 7-10 days and other can take up to 6-9 weeks to dissolve. It’s best to ask your surgeon as he/she knows what suture they used. ( Asif Pirani, MD, FRCS(C) , Toronto Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>It May Take Up To 7-10 Days for Stitches to Dissolve</h3><p>When wounds are closed with fast absorbing gut suture it generally takes about 7 to 10 days before they dissolve. Often residual portions of the suture can be associated with crusting and scabbing. When this happens it can increase the incidence of scarring.</p><p>This can be avoided by daily cleansing and the application of antibiotic ointment. After 6 to 7 days these sutures serve no function and can be removed. ( Richard J. Bruneteau, MD , Omaha Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>How long will it take for my sutures to dissolve</h3><p>I usually use a 6-0 fast absorbing gut suture and it takes about 4-6 days to dissolve. Frequently, the portion of the suture on the under surface of the incision will dissolve before the outer portion of the suture. In this instance the outer portion of the suture can simply be removed from the eyelid gently with a tweezer. I advise my patients against trying to remove their own sutures as they may undo the incision. If the sutures are taking longer than normal to dissolve I would follow up with your surgeon and he can remove them in his or her office. ( Todd C. Miller, MD , Newport Beach Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Dissolving stitches used in upper lid blepharoplasty</h3><p>When dissolvable (aka absorbable) stitches are used in the eyelid, they usually dissolve in about a 7-10 day period if fast absorbing gut is used. Dissolve may be not be a totally accurate word as they usually break and small strands will fall out. There are other absorbable sutures in use, but other types are not typically used in the lid because they last too long. Sutures that stay in past that 1 to 1.5 week time period have a greater chance of having an unfavorable scar and formation of milia.</p><p>One way to make the sutures dissolve in an appropriate (and fast) manner is to make sure that they are always kept moist and lubricated. Your physician may have prescribed an antibiotic ointment to put on the wound and stitches, or may have instructed you to put vaseline ointment on them. In any case, keeping them moist will make the wound heal faster allow for the suture to dissolve in an appropriate manner. ( Michael M. Kim, MD , Portland Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>How Long Until Plastic Surgery Stitches Dissolve</h3><p>If Fast Absorbing Gut is used it will usually dissolve in 8-10 days. I use Silk and Prolene and remove both and resteristrip in 5 days. ( Paul Vitenas, Jr., MD , Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Dissolving sutures</h3><p>In both upper and lower blepharoplasty surgery and in the rest of my facial surgery I use permanent 5-0 and 6-0 sutures and not dissolvable chromic sutures. The reason for this is twofold:</p><ol>
<li>They are more inert and less reactive so there is less pain and inflammation at the suture line</li>
<li>They heal better with less scarring and a better cosmetic result.</li>
</ol><p>These two factors are much more important than any concerns about having to remove the sutures one week post surgery ( Richard Galitz, MD, FACS , Miami Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Left in Stitches?!</h3><p>Eyelid stitches are routinely removed in 4-5 days. Some doctors will use “fast-absorbing” stitches that begin to dissolve within a few days and have lost most of their strength by 5-7 days.</p><p>Although these colorless stitches may sit on the skin longer, they really are doing anything after that time, so they can fall off or be removed. But even so-called “permanent” stitches are removed by 4-5 days.</p><p>For dissolvable stitches, there really isn’t anything you could do to help them dissolve faster, but if they are still sitting there after 5 days, they could also be removed.</p><p>I will use the dissolvable stitches if I think the patient may be bothered by the stitch removal of the permanent ones. ( Richard G. Schwartz, MD , West Palm Beach Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Suture Removal After Blepharoplasty</h3><p>Optimally, sutures can be removed 5-7 days depending on the type of operative procedure that you did on the eyes. If you preserve muscle then one needs to leave it in a little longer. ( Rod J. Rohrich, MD , Dallas Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Plastic Surgery Stitches dissolve</h3><p>That depends on the area. For a blepharoplasty of the upper eyelid we would do two layers of stitches; one superficial and one deeper down. The non superficial ones would be very fine, to create a more beautiful look, and therefore dissolve within 7-10 days. ( Edward E. Dickerson, IV, MD , Fayetteville Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>How long for stitches to dissolve</h3><p>There are different types and sizes of dissolving sutures used for blepharoplasty. The ones I use (6-0 fast absorbing gut sutures) typically dissolve in 4-8 days. Check with your doctor to find out the time course based on the type of sutures used. Although your body will dissolve the portion of the sutures beneath the skin, the part of the suture above the skin may remain for longer than the 10-day mark.</p><p>I recommend keeping your skin moist and gently washing the area with a cotton swab and water which hastens the removal of the remnants. Never use hydrogen peroxide on the eyelids as if it gets into the eye it can cause a chemical burn. Residual sutures at this point should be removed by your doctor. ( Larry S. Nichter, MD, MS, FACS , Orange County Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Time period for stitch dissolution</h3><p>Each dissolving suture material has different thickness and time period for the disintegration. There is nothing you can do to make the sutures dissolve faster.</p><p>They are there for a reason, to hold the wound together while your body heals. Follow your surgeon’s instructions. ( Robert L. Kraft, MD , New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Stitch Dissolve Time?</h3><p>Depending on the type of suture used, most is old sutures in this area dissolve between 1 to 2 weeks after surgery. They may be removed sooner by your surgeon. ( Tom J. Pousti, MD, FACS , San Diego Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Dissolving sutures used in eyelid surgery</h3><p>Don’t worry. You should be only days away from having the sutures disappear if fast dissolving chromic sutures were used by your Plastic Surgeon. There is nothing that you have to do. Verify with your doctor as to the type of sutures used for the surgery. ( Francis (Frank) William Rieger, MD , Tampa Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Eyelid Surgery should be gone in 7-10 days</h3><p>How Long Until Plastic Surgery Stitches Dissolve? I had upper Eyelid Surgery 8 days ago, and the doctor used dissolvable stitches. How long does it normally take for stitches to dissolve?</p><p>Is there anything I can do to make them dissolve faster? There are many different types of sutures. It depends on the sutures your surgeon used. Usually for eyelids 7-10 days the sutures should be gone. ( Sonia Badreshia-Bansal, MD , Bay Area Dermatologist)</p></div>
