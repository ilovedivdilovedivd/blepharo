<div overflow></div></amp-ad><div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><h3>Droopy eyelids alternatives to surgery</h3><p>The aging process in the upper and lower lids is quite different, so treatments are different correspondingly. The upper eyelids age by creating inelasticity of the upper eyelid skin and a small herniation of the 2 fat pads in the upper lid. The lower lids age primarily by herniation of the 3 fats pad creating the “puffiness” look. In addition over age 50 excess skin starts to become inelastic underneath the lower lids. Medical issues that need to be addressed include making sure there is no thyroid eye disease, all inhaled allergies are under control with medications or environmental avoidance, and a low salt diet.</p><p>Non-surgical alternatives treatment to rejuvenation of the eyelids include Botox to the corrugators and crows feet area, fillers can be placed in the tear troughs, and laser resurfacing can be performed on the lower lids to help tighten excess skin on the lower lids. When all of the above has been tried, consideration for the surgical alternatives such as upper and lower lid blepharoplasty can be entertained. For many examples of eyelid surgery, please see the link below (William Portuese, MD, )</p><h3>Non surgical treatment for droopy eyelids</h3><p>Lateral eyelid and brow ptosis can give your eyes a heavy and tired appearance. Botox to the tail of the eyebrow and crow’s foot region will provide a chemical browlift which often can give upwards of 1/2 to 1 cm of lateral lift. Often, this can take you far enough down the road to improvement obviating the need for any surgery. At the very least, you will be able to have a rational idea of where brow position may end up after a surgical procedure. This is an excellent option for a broad range of patients. (Shepherd G. Pryor, MD, Scottsdale Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_423" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><h3>Saggy Eyelids</h3><p>Neurotoxins like Botox, Dysport, and Xeomine can temporarily raise the eyebrows and reduce minimal excess skin on upper eyelids.</p><p>A filler under the eyebrow can also temporarily raise the brow and diminish minimal excess upper eyelid skin. A chemical peel can tighten the skin, reduce minimal excess skin, and fine lines.</p><p>Consult a Board Certified Plastic Surgeon. (George C. Peck, Jr, MD, West Orange Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Droopy Eyelids – Alternatives to Eyelift Surgery?</h3><p>Once the eyelid skin has become loose above or below the eyes its best approached is to be treated surgically.</p><p>For many patients who have upper eyelid excess skin many times simply we’ve been fixing the brow with an endoscopic technique which is 3 one inch incisions and have dramatic effect on the appearance on the upper eyelid so the incision there simply look at yourself in the mirror, raise your brow up to an appropriate position and that can be an achievable outcome for a brow lift on your eyelid.</p><p>While there is no incision on your eyelids and you have that outcome improvement. (Paul Vanek, MD, Cleveland Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>A fast and non-surgical approach for raising the eyelid</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_424" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-34995e66c422e6d315276f7e9f6196f4">

</div><p>Botox can help with raising the eyelid. Typically the results will last 3 – 6 months and is not a permanent solution. Be sure to visit a Board Certified Surgeon and discuss in consultation the non-surgical and surgical options that would be best for you. (Frank Lista, MD, Toronto Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Is there a non-surgical way to improve the eyelids?</h3><p>As you can see from the many answers below, there are some alternatives treatment to surgical eyelid rejuvenation. At times, this can be achieved nicely by the astute placement of botulinum toxins, fillers, and/or lasers.</p><p>A combination of one or more of these agents is commonly used to perform eyelid rejuvenation on younger patients, called the “liquid eyelid lift.”</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_425" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>However, a truthful and reputable surgeon will hopefully not try and sell you on costly products if they are unlikely to create a large enough difference. I am often very direct with my patients, which they like very much, and explain to them that we can either spend $2500 on fillers, botox and lasers and see you again in 9 months or we can perform the best surgery for you and see you back in 5 years! I am honest and let the patient decide what is best for them. Good luck to you. (Erez Sternberg, MD, Jacksonville Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Eyelid Surgery alternatives</h3><p>Droopy eyelids usually respond to surgical intervention very well and will give you the result that will make you the happiest and only takes 30 min.</p><p>However, if you’re looking for alternatives, botox can help lift the edges of the brows 1-3 mm to lessen the heaviness on the outer eyelids.</p><p>Also, adding volume around and under the brow on either side can also lessen the appearance of eyelid heaviness.</p><p>CO2 laser resurfacing in the office does have downtime but can be performed with topical anesthesia and tighten the extra skin to improve the appearance. Combining all 3 is also an option. (Mike Majmundar, MD, Atlanta Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Alternatives to eyelid surgery</h3><p>Generally speaking, the most optimum results would come from eyelid surgery. However, my patients who are not ready for a surgical procedure may opt for neurotoxins (Xeomin, Botox, etc.) and/or fillers to achieve temporary relief.</p><p>We also have an array of lasers to treat our patients’ specific needs. (Ross A. Clevens, MD, Melbourne Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Eyelid lift</h3><p>There really is no non surgical way to correct droopy lids that actually works. Puppet loud surgery is actually an easy oricedure to go through, usually done under local anesthesia. (Ronald J. Edelson, MD, San Diego Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Do I need surgery for droopy eyelids?</h3><p>Surgery for droopy eyelids is very effective. As an alternative, laser resurfacing using a fractional CO2 laser can have wonderful results. (Jose E. Barrera, MD, FACS, San Antonio Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Droopy Eyelids – Alternatives to Eyelift Surgery?</h3><p>It is difficult to comment accurately re/ what you are a candidate for. However, generally speaking excess upper eyelid skin is treated surgically (called blepharoplasty) – and produces great results. There are treatments: like lasers, creams – but if you truly are a candidate for blepharoplasty – non of the non surgical treatments will produce dramatic change – in my opinion. (Thomas Trevisani, Sr., MD, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Eyelid Surgery Is the Best Bet</h3><p>Unfortunately, there are no really good non-surgical treatments for “sagging eyelids.” BOTOX can be used in an attempt to raise the brow, and this may slightly reduce the excess skin in the upper eyelids, but this is only temporary and will not actually reduce the excess skin.</p><p>Other skin tightening treatments will not be as dramatic as surgery and may not be safe in the eyelid region. Blepharoplasty is a relatively simple surgery with a short downtime.</p><p>I recommend discussing your concerns with qualified surgeons in your area. (Louis C. Cutolo, Jr., MD, FACS, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Alternatives to surgery for droopy eyelids</h3><p>There are numerous alternatives to surgery when it comes to sagging upper eyelids and baggy lower eyelids. These alternatives range from minimal noninvasive lifestyle changes like a low-salt diet to more involved but still non-surgical alternatives such as laser resurfacing or chemical peels. Somewhere in the middle of that spectrum are the most popular and most used options: neuromodulators like Botox mostly for the upper lids, and filler for the lower eyelids.</p><p>Often times, a minimal surgical approach used with one of these alternatives as an adjunct treatment is a great way to go, addressing the true aging process instead of focusing on just one area. Seek out an expert opinion to help best decide which of these alternatives would be best for you. Everybody’s eyelids are a bit different, and there is not a one-size-fits-all approach to it. Choose a dermatologic surgeon, oculoplastic surgeon, facial plastic surgeon or plastic surgeon who is board certified and fellowship trained in one of these court cosmetic specialties. (Cameron Chesnut, MD, FAAD, FACMS, FASDS, Spokane Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p></p>

</div> </center><h3>Non surgical treatment of droopy lids</h3><p>There are no good alternatives other than make up to try and improve lids that have excess skin, are droopy or have lots of puffiness to them (herniated fat). Eyelid surgery is the only option. (Michael Loeffler, MD, Pompano Beach Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Surgery may be your easiest option</h3><p>I understand that everyone has a certain reluctance to undergo surgery and that is probably a sensible and safe response.</p><p>In the case of upper eyelid surgery however, you may find that the non surgical approaches have far less satisfactory results and are often quite short lived in their effect.</p><p>Upper eyelid reduction can easily be done under local anaesthetic and is no more difficult for you than a root canal. You may not like root canal treatment but you tolerate it perfectly well!</p><p>There are instances for the lower lid where the non surgical option may actually give a better result (such as a strong tear trough with no loose skin) but for the saggy upper lid, there is usually a week to ten days of time off and you have a good long term result. (Dan Kennedy, MBBS, FRACS (plast), Brisbane Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Alternatives to Eyelift Surgery</h3><p>As a surgeon, I only recommend a procedure to a patient if I think it can help to address their concerns and help them in their lives going forward.</p><p>It is certainly natural to want to avoid surgery. In my practice, we answer all of our patients’ questions to make sure that they are comfortable with our plan.</p><p>Depending on your particular case, it may be better to try non-surgical alternatives prior to going under the knife. I would recommend a consultation with an oculoplastic surgeon to discuss your concerns and form a common plan to achieve your goals. (Samuel Baharestani, MD, Long Island Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Nonsurgical eye lift</h3><p>While blepharoplasty is the most definitive solution to agng eyes, there are several non-surgical alternatives:</p><ol>
<li>Botox to the orbicularis oculi muscles to give a slight lift to the brows</li>
<li>Filler (such as Juvederm or Restylane) to the tear troughs to smooth the lid-cheek junction and mask tiredness of the lower eyelids</li>
<li>Laser to the lower lids for skin tightening</li>
<li>Skin care such as retinoids, vitamin C, and hydroquinone to refine fine lines and pigmentary changes around the eyes (Lara Devgan, MD, MPH, New York Plastic Surgeon)</li>
</ol><h3>Nonsurgical eyelid lift</h3><p>Botox can help lift the brow area and the eyelids, while fillers may help the lower eyelids by erasing wrinkles and undereye circles. (Jerome Edelstein, MD, Toronto Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Botox could help</h3><p>Botox may help lift the upper eyelids for a nonsurgical blepharoplasty, but it really depends on an assessment by a board certified plastic surgeon to see if it would help you. (Michael Constantin Gartner, DO, Paramus Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Alternatives to Eyelid lift Surgery?</h3><p>Sagging eyelids or hooding is common process of aging. Although there are a lot of claims from companies that there are alternatives to surgery by using their creams and gels, most people are left with little or no result and feeling frustrated.</p><p>There is no alternative to replace the surgical eyelid lift that would leave a person feeling satisfied that their money was well spent. Reducing salty food, drink loads of water and get lots of sleep, or loosing weight can help in some cases but is hardly an alternative. Botox can raise the upper eyelids but also can have a reverse effect and leave them feeling as though their lids are heavy. The best eyelid rejuvenation would require surgery. (Alfred Sofer, MD, FACS, Fairfield Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>For the upper eyelids, strictly, the only nonsurgical option there may be is Botox to improve the brow position. And therefore, by virtue of changing the brow position, this may improve one’s perception of excess skin on the upper lids. (Glynn Bolitho, PhD, MD, FACS, San Diego Plastic Surgeon)</p><p></p>
