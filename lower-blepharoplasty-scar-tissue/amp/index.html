<div overflow></div></amp-ad><div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>Lower Blepharoplasty Scar tissue is extremely rare and it usually only happen when the surgeon has no experience with the delicate eyelid structures. So make sure when having surgery around the eyes at least look for an oculoplastic surgeon. (Kami K. Parsa, MD, Los Angeles Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p><h3>For practical purposes, you cannot see Blepharoplasty scars.</h3><p>Of course, there are no guarantees, and there is always the posibility of a complication, but in most patients you cannot notice the scars of blepharoplasty. 20% of our blepharoplasty patients are men, and they are fine with no make up. (George J. Beraka, MD (retired), Manhattan Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>No scar is completely invisible, but eyelid scars are about as good as it gets. After the scar remodels and the redness is gone, they are effectively invisible.</p><p>I think for facial aging, properly performed eyelid surgery gives the most for the least.  (Vincent N. Zubowicz, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Upper eyelid surgery results in minimal scars.</h3><p>Blepharoplasties (eyelid surgery) are probably the single most valuable treatment for a patient to experience.</p><p>Assuming that you want to look more refreshed (yet still natural), removing excessive tissue from the upper eyelid region is the right choice.</p><p>As we communicate by looking at each others eyes, this is often the first thing that we begin to notice as we begin to age.</p><p>We typically see that patients will raise their eyebrows while getting ready in the morning. This is true for both men and women.</p><p>We feel good and look refreshed and then we go about our day. However, when we catch a glimpse of ourselves in the mirror or when a candid photo is taken (one we aren’t posing for), we often look “tired” and less “refreshed.”</p><p>Besides being so valuable, the incision should heal without any perceptible scar.</p><p>Of course there is always a scar present, but it is placed in the natural eyelid crease and therefore no one will ever see it. (Jon E. Mendelsohn, MD, Cincinnati Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Upper blepharoplasty scars</h3><p>The scars from an eyelid lift, or a upper blepharoplasty, almost always heal to the point that they are virtually imperceptable. It does take a few months after surgery for the scars to go away and, in the meantime, you may need to wear some makeup to camouflage their appearance.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_537" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d87d550619663a1157fa2e6f7e0b1eb5">

</div><p>In many cases after about six months you won’t be able to see the scars, even if you look closely for them. Eyelid skin is very thin and because of this, scars heal extremely well following eyelid surgery. (Ronald J. Edelson, MD, San Diego Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Eyelid surgery Scars</h3><p>Upper eyelid surgery, like all surgical procedures that use incisions, will result in scars. Scars will always be present but can be hard to see once mature if placed strategically and closed with minimal tension.</p><p>The eyelid skin is the thinnest on the body so the scars become almost invisible, although they never totally disappear. (Christopher J. Schaffer, MD, Birmingham Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_538" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>The incisions after eyelid surgery should heal well and they should not be visible. (Andres Bustillo, MD, FACS, Miami Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Scarring after upper eyelid surgery</h3><p>Scarring after eyelid surgery (upper or lower) is rarely a problem. The incisions are placed into natural creases and shadowed areas and generally heal very well. Occasionally, some mild thickening in certain ethnic skin types may require topical or subcutaneous cortisone. (Roy A. David, MD, San Diego Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_539" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><h3>Eyelid Lift Scarring</h3><p>It is unlikely that you will have obvious scarring following an eyelid lift. By definition, you will scar from the procedure. However, in experienced hands blepharoplasty incisions can be closed with meticulous technique to produce scars that are barely visible. (John M. Hilinski, MD, San Diego Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Upper eyelid surgery (blepharoplasty) surgery scars are usually nearly invisible</h3><p>The skin in the upper eyelid is so thin that it’s hard to create a poor scar there. Placement of the scar is important, so that it sits in the crease of the eyelid. And meticulous closure is the final touch that ensures good healing. (Carmen Kavali, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>All incisions leave scars but eyelid surgery scars heal incredibly well</h3><p>No matter where an incision is made or who creates it a scar will result. In blepharoplasty, there are several factors that result in good scars:</p><ol>
<li>Incisions are placed in the eyelid crease.</li>
<li>No tension on the incisions.</li>
<li>Eyelid skin heals very well.</li>
</ol><p>Laterally extended eyelid scars (beyond the orbital rim can be visible). Therefore, I prefer to perform a browlift to deal with this issue of hooding rather than extending the eyelid incision outside the eyelid crease and beyond the orbital rim. Camouflage makeup can be worn by women during the early healing period. This is most often used for lower eyelid surgery when the incision is placed below the eyelashes or when a conservative amount of lower eyelid skin is removed. (Stephen Weber, MD, FACS, Denver Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Scarring from upper blepharoplasty is minimal and not usually a big concern. Discuss your options with a local plastic surgeon. (David J. Levens, MD, Coral Springs Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Nearly invisible eyelid scars</h3><p>With the exception of lower eyelid trasconjunctival surgery, there is always an incision on eyelid skin. Fortunately with well executed upper blepharoplasty these scars become nearly invisible with time.</p><p>Only on very rare occasion upper blepharoplasty scar tissue is noticeable, and usually it can be improved with touch up surgery. (Boris M. Ackerman, MD, Newport Beach Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Scar following upper blepharoplasty</h3><p>Whenever skin is cut there will be scars. The trick is to place the scars in places that they cannot be seen or in a fold of skin which is never exposed.</p><p>Upper blepharoplasty lends itself very well to this. There is a normal fold in the upper eyelid when the eyes are open. The trained plastic surgeon only places their incisions in this fold.</p><p>Untrained surgeons place their scars above the fold or near the eyebrow which is a bad since they are clearly visible. To answer your question, you should not have visible scars following a blepharoplasty.</p><p>I have never seen a bad scar unless it is in the wrong place or the surgeon took to much skin. I have never seen a keloid scar tissue even in keloid formers following eye surgery. (Gary H. Manchester, MD (retired), San Diego Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Eyelid incisions heal very well</h3><p>The skin of the eyelid is the thinnest skin of the human body. Therefore, the incisions in this area heal extremely well- they are very difficult to see. This applies to both the upper and the lower eyelid areas.</p><p>Oftentimes the lower eyelid incision is done on the inside of the eyelid, which is called transconjunctival, which leaves no external scar tissue at all. A board certified plastic surgeon can examine you and determine which incision is best for you. (William Bruno, MD, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Upper blepharoplasty scars</h3><p>The upper eyelid incision is placed in the crease of the upper eyelid, which makes it only minimally visible most of the time. The lower eyelid incision is frequently placed inside the eyelid, which makes it totally invisible. If, however, an external eyelid incision is required on the lower eyelid due to your specific anatomy, this too is usually minimally noticeable.</p><p>This area tends to heal very nicely. In most patients, I prefer to complete the incisions as well as use laser light treatments to the upper and lower eyelid and crows foot area to obtain maximum improvement. (Deason Dunagan, MD, Huntsville Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>The scars will be hidden in your eyelid creases</h3><p>With any surgical procedure that requires an incision there will be some form of scar. Fortunately eyelid skin heals better than any other area of the body. In addition a well placed eyelid incision looks like a natural skin crease which provides the ultimate in camouflage. Yes there will be a fine scar tissue with any upper blepharoplasty but the overall cosmetic improvement is often well worth it. (Thomas Buonassisi, MD, Vancouver Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Eyelid scars are very difficult to see</h3><p>Eyelid scars are very difficult to see if placed properly and closed well. All scars are somewhat visiible if you look close enough; however, fortunately, eyelid skin is very thin and tends to have very fine scars. Of course, if the lower blepharoplasty is performed by the transconjuctival approach, no scars are visible. (Sanjay Grover, MD, Orange County Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Lower blepharoplasty scars</h3><p>Scarring from eyelid surgery is very uncommon. Usually, lower lid Blepharoplasty can be performed through a transconjunctival incision.</p><p>This means that the incision is made on the inside of the lower eyelid so no visible incision is made on the skin. For the upper lids the incision is made through the skin and is placed in the upper lid crease.</p><p>Because the incision is made in the lid crease the incision is hidden. This incision usually heals very well and after a short time it is not visible at all. (David Freilich, MD, Englewood Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p><p>Some patients with minimal fat bulging and no excess skin can undergo a transconjunctival blepharoplasty. The incision is placed on the inside of the eye and therefore, patients have no visible scars.</p><p>However, in most patients a formal upper or lower eyelid blepharoplasty does create scars that are imperceptible to most people.</p><p>If you look closely you can always see the scar, but eyelid skin does heal extremely well. To learn more visit our site below. (Ankit Desai, MD, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Visible scars from lower eyelid surgery</h3><p>If you look hard enough you will ALWAYS see a fine line scar. If this is a worry than look at having this type of operation as a trade off – the scar for younger looking eyes. I bet it will be worth it. (Darryl J. Blinski, MD, Seattle Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Eyelid surgery scars should be invisible</h3><p>Properly placed eyelid surgery incisions are virtually invisible after they heal. Make sure to go to a plastic surgeon, facial plastic surgeon or ophthmalogist for the best results. (Richard P. Rand, MD, FACS, Seattle Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Lower eyelid surgery scars should be very inconspicuous</h3><p>Every time a cut is made in the skin it heals with a scar, but the eyelids offer unique opportunities to hide the scars. Part of this is because the skin is thin and tends to not make much of a scar in the first place. The other thing is placement; in the upper eyelids the scar will tuck into the natural crease, and for the lower eyelids it is hidden just below the eyelashes about 2 millimeters below the edge of the lid. (Richard Baxter, MD, Milwaukee Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Invisible eyelid surgery is possible</h3><p>There are different ways to approach lower eyelid surgery. In the appropriate patient it is possible to do the lower lid from the inside, otherwise known as transconjunctival blepharoplasty. For the upper lid, the scar tissue will hidden in the crease. Sometimes it needs to be extended into one of the crow’s feet, which over the long run tends to be virtually invisible. The thin skin of the eyelid area in general heals with minimal scarring, and so if an external approach is needed for the lower eyelid in order to get a better result, I would not hesitate to go that route. (Paul W. Loewenstein, MD, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Eyelid Skin heals beautifully</h3><p>The skin of the eyelids is extremely forgiving. Your plastic surgeon should review your surgical options including the placement of scars. Certain types of violent surgery can avoid visible scars altogether. Certain techniques such as the trans-conjunctival blepharoplasty allow for the surgery to be performed without placing a single scar on your skin. Ask your plastic surgeon if you are a candidate for these procedures. (Pat Pazmino, MD)</p><h3>Lower eyelid surgery scars</h3><p>The scars that result from eyelid surgery are very thin and hardly noticeable. For the upper lid, the scar is placed in the skin fold. For the lower lid, the scar may be just under the eyelashes, or inside the eyelid. Make-up can easily hide the scars as they are healing, but nothing will be needed after several weeks. (Randy J. Buckspan, MD, Austin Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Eyelid surgery is consistently the most popular procedure to rejuvenate the face. It’s affordable, easy to recover from, and makes a great improvement.</p><p>The scars are usually virtually invisible, particularly in the upper lid where when the eye is open, you physically can’t seen the scar at all since its folded up in the open upper eyelid.</p><p>Lower lid scars are usually really hard to find and are certainly not noticeable by the average person. Of course, every patient is different and healing ability does play a role.</p><p>Generally speaking, however, eyelid surgery scars are some of the best, most discrete scars in the body. (Adam Rubinstein, MD, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Incisions for upper eyelid surgery are made in the natural crease of the lid which occurs when the eye is open. The incision for lower lid surgery is made just below the lash line.</p><p>Both of these incisions are closed with sutures that begin to dissolve about day 4 or 5 post surgery.</p><p>These incisions heal very quickly and will only be light pink in color. Once the incisions are completely sealed, about 2 weeks after surgery, new, bacteria free, makeup can be patted on the incisions.</p><p>Within 2 to 3 months they should be undetectable. (Harold J. Kaplan, MD, Los Angeles Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Scars after eyelid surgery</h3><p>While it is possible to have scars after eyelid surgery they usually are minimally noticeable. If the incisions, when placed properly are usually in the fold when you open your eyes.</p><p>The lower skin incision in usually places a few millimeters below the eye lashes and are thus minimally noticeable initially and almost gone over a few week period.</p><p>The incision for the lower lid may be done inside the eye (transconjunctival) and therefore would never be visible. Again, ask your surgeon what his or her experience is as each doctor’s results do vary. (Carlos Wolf, MD, Miami Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Blepharoplasty incisions are not visible</h3><p>There are two types of Blepharoplasty or Eyelid Lift Surgery:</p><p>1) Upper Blepharoplasty – Here, the incisions are made in the natural crease of the upper eyelid. The eyelid skin is probably the best healing skin of the body. The resulting scars are not only imperceptible because they are placed in the crease, but the scar itslef heals to a very faint line that is difficult to even see when looking for it.</p><p>2) Lower Blepharoplasty – There are two approaces to perform this surgery. I prefer what is called the transconjunctival approach. Here all of the incisions are made inside the eyelid, so there is no skin incisions and hence no scars. The other approach, which I do not prefer (reasons for another topic), is the transcutaneous approach. Here the incision is placed under the eyelash line. This heals to a very faint line, which is most often not perceivable. Bottom line is that the scars from blepharoplasty are well concealed and eyelid skin heals beautifully. (Jacob D. Steiger, MD, Boca Raton Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Blepharoplasty scars</h3><p>Blepharoplasty incisions are one of the best healing in the body. The upper eyelid one is barely noticeable once it has healed, and even during the early stages it is concealed within the crease.</p><p>Lower eyelid surgery can be performed in several ways. If the incisions are on the inside of the eyelid, then they will never be seen. If there is a need to remove excess skin, then the incision is in a natural crease just below the eyelashes. This heals remarkably well too. (Edmon Pierre Khoury, MD, Lone Tree Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Eyelid incisions heal beautifully</h3><p>Eyelid incisons usually heal beautifully with scars that are not visible when viewed from conversational distance. If a makeup artist is applying your makeup, she might see a very thin, pale upper eyelid scar. This is non-visible to casual observers, not noticed even when you blink. The lower eyelid scar is usually even less conspicuous. If a patient has a scar that is more visible, this is very rare, a good medical tatoo artist can help camaflouge this. Hope this helps. (Tracy Pfeifer, MD, Manhattan Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Scarring associated with Eyelid Surgery is virtually invisible</h3><p>I have been performing cosmetic eyelid surgery for 35 years and have never seen any scars secondary to this surgery that have in the long run have amounted to anything noticeable.</p><p>Yes, there is scarring but you have to look at very close range to discern its presence.</p><p>In addition, the upper lid scar is strategically place in the fold and cannot be seen with the eyes open. The lower lid scarring is placed just below the lashes where women apply eyeliner.</p><p>Of course, in the first few months after surgery scars have pinkish hue and are somewhat more visible. But they do fade rapidly and become virtually invisible. (David A. Ross, MD, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Difficult to see scar from eyelid surgery</h3><p>Upper blepharoplasty will leave a scar, but correctly performed will leave a scar that is practically invisible.</p><p>Many lower blepharoplasties are performed via a transconjunctival approach (or on the inside layer of the lower lid).</p><p>These don’t leave a scar. A lower blepharoplasty can also be performed via a subciliary approach (just under the eyelid).</p><p>This may result in a visible scar, but, again, if performed well the scar should be imperceptible. (Corey S. Maas, MD, San Francisco Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Eyelid incisions for Blepharoplasty</h3><p>Eyelid incisions vary for blepharoplasty. If fat is taken out of the lower lids form inside, you will not see visible incisions. Remarkably, the external eyelid incisions usually heal extremely well. (Steven Wallach, MD, Manhattan Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Visible scars after eyelid surgery</h3><p>Visible scars after eyelid surgery are uncommon if done correctly. Typically the upper eyelid scars are made in the crease of the upper eyelids and generally heal well in people of all skin types.</p><p>My preference is to use dissolvable sutures and glue which minimize the stitch lines. In the lower eyelids, often the incision can be made behind the eyelid leaving no visible scars. (Scott Trimas, MD, Jacksonville Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Not usually. For upper eyelid surgery, the incision is made in the natural eyelid crease. Once healed, this line is imperceptible. Lower eyelid surgery can be done with several different approaches.</p><p>One of the approaches is done through the inside of the lower eyelid. There are no visible scars if this is done. Other approaches do make an incision through the skin but again, this incision once healed is usually not seen. (D.J. Verret, MD, Dallas Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>With respect to the lower eyelid, the incision is usually made on the inside portion of the eyelid. If there is redundant skin on the lower lid, an external incision is placed directly below the lash line and is closed with Histoacryl tissue adhesive (or “tissue glue”). This forms a miniscule fine line that is barely visible after two to three weeks following surgery.</p><p>The curl of the lower lid lashes also helps to conceal the healing incision line. With respect to upper eyelid surgery, the incision is well hidden within the fold of the upper lid and is blended into the crow’s feet crease out laterally.</p><p>This incision will remain pink for a couple of months. However, patients are able to place makeup over the incisions after the first week after the surgery. (William Portuese, MD, Seattle Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Blepharoplasty can be performed without visible scars</h3><p>Upper eyelid surgery is performed through an incision placed along the natural eyelid fold which is not visible. IA small extension of this incision extends out about 1/4 to 1/2 beyond the natural eyelid fold into a crows foot with minimal visibility. Lower eyelid surgery can be performed without any external eyelid incision. A small incision is made behind the eye lid in the mucous membranes.</p><p>This is referred to the transconjunctival (mucous membrane) approach. It has also been referred to as “stitchless Blepharoplasty”. This approach to the lower eyelids is ideal for someone who has excess fatty deposits creating puffiness with overlying eyelid skin that can be rejuvenated with a peel or laser. There are times when there is too much laxity or excess lower eyelid skin with wrinkles requiring an external incision to address this excess.</p><p>This is also referred to a “subcilliary (under the eyelash) approach”. Once fully healed, the incision has minimal visibility. In summary, whether there are external incisions or only completely hidden incisions, both heal well and are usually not visible once the healing is complete.</p><p>You should have your plastic surgeon select the approach based on what your needs are rather than trying to avoid an external incision at the cost of compromising your results. (Ran Y. Rubinstein, MD, Manhattan Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Eyelid surgery scars can be well hidden</h3><p>Upper eyelid blepharoplasty scars are placed in the natural fold of the upper eyelid and should only be visible with the eyelids closed. These scars heal very well and are usually very faint. The lower eyelid scars can be placed inside the lower eyelid – the transconjunctival lower blepharoplasty – and thus are not visible. (Brooke R. Seckel, MD, FACS, Boston Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
