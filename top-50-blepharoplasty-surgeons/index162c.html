You should also feel comfortable with your doctor at consultation and not feel pushed into surgery.</p><p>Blepharoplasty is an operation to remove subcutaneous fat in order to get rid of facial wrinkles in the upper or lower eyelid. Correction of age-related skin changes is performed with the help of a simple surgical procedure. As a result, the patient acquires an instant rejuvenating effect and a fresh, open mind.</p><h3>What is blepharoplasty performed?</h3><p>There are three types of surgery for blepharoplasty:<br>
<strong>– Upper blepharoplasty</strong> (is an operation to remove fat in the upper eyelid);<br>
<strong>– Lower blepharoplasty</strong> (the fatty layer is removed from the lower eyelids);<br>
<strong>– Transconjunctival blepharoplasty</strong> (removal of the fat layer from the lower eyelids with a laser) is an innovative approach in modern plastic surgery.</p><p>As for the first two types of surgery, they are classified as traditional methods of aesthetic medicine.</p><p><em>How is the blepharoplasty surgery performed? Let’s consider some of its stages:</em></p><p>– The surgeon, with the help of a scalpel, makes an incision just below the growth of the eyelashes (if the lower eyelid is operated);<br>
– Then subcutaneous fat, neoplasms and excess skin are removed;<br>
– At the end of the operation doctor put the finest, inconspicuous stitches in a wound.</p><p>The procedure is similar in the area of the upper eyelid, but the incision is made in its natural skin fold.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2742" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Surgeons prefer to use local anesthesia during blepharoplasty surgery. The recovery period after blepharoplasty of the upper or lower eyelids, circular blepharoplasty is about 12 days. On day 3, the doctor removes the stitches. The following minor complications during recovery after blepharoplasty are possible:</p><ol>
<li>Swelling;</li>
<li>Bruises;</li>
<li>Increased sensitivity of the mucous corners of the eyes.</li>
</ol><p>As a rule, these complications disappear after 5 days. Doctors recommend using moisturizing gels for the skin around the eyes and hypoallergenic drops to remove the syndrome of unpleasant sensations. It is forbidden to apply makeup to the face for 10 days.</p><p>If you have a thin and sensitive skin, then you should prepare for a long process of recovery after blepharoplasty. Modern aesthetic medicine offers a new way to perform surgery is a transconjunctive method to avoid a long recovery period and complications. In this case, the surgical procedure is performed using a laser.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2743" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>A small incision is made on the inside of the eyelid, through which excess fatty tissue is removed (eg, hernia). The main advantages of this method are:</p><ol>
<li>No visible seams;</li>
<li>Recovery after laser blepharoplasty lasts much less than with traditional methods of surgical intervention;</li>
<li>Facial expressions are not violated.</li>
</ol><h4>How to choose a clinic and surgeon?</h4><p>Preparation for blepharoplasty involves not only a preoperative examination, but also the choice of a clinic for the operation, and most importantly, it is a doctor. The following points should be important to you as for a potential client:</p><ul>
<li>Qualification of the surgeon;</li>
<li>practical experience;</li>
<li>Visual results.</li>
</ul><p>It is very important for the surgeon to have a good portfolio, so that the client can compare the photo “before” and the photo immediately after blepharoplasty, which should be presented on the official website of the plastic surgery clinic. On its basis the patient can make a conclusion about the quality of the operation.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2744" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><h3>Preparatory stage.</h3><p>During preparation for surgery the doctor prescribes a survey in which finds the following facts:</p><ol>
<li>Whether the patient has any chronic diseases;</li>
<li>Whether there are eye diseases;</li>
<li>Whether there were earlier surgical interventions (including a maxillofacial plastic surgeries).</li>
</ol><p>This information is necessary so that the surgeon can choose the safest method of conducting the operation. The necessary tests before blepharoplasty.</p><ul>
<li>general blood analysis;</li>
<li>blood chemistry;</li>
<li>An analysis that determines the level of blood clotting;</li>
<li>An analysis aimed at detecting the level of sugar in the blood;</li>
<li>electrocardiogram.</li>
</ul><p>In addition, the physician should also know other important information about the patient:</p><p>!! Important! If, during the preparation for blepharoplasty, the survey revealed that the client suffers from such diseases, as glaucoma, then a consultation of an ophthalmologist is needed, which can give a competent conclusion as to whether the operation is possible or not. Important in the preparation for blepharoplasty are the following studies that are carried out by a plastic surgeon:</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2745" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

<li>It determines the volume of excess skin;</li>
<li>The possibility of ptosis of the eyelid is predicted;</li>
<li>The depth of wrinkles is estimated;</li>
<li>The tonus of the cartilaginous part is assessed;</li>
<li>The amount of fat surplus is estimated;</li>
<li>Computer simulation of the final result is carried out.</li>
</ul><h3>Postoperative period and recovery</h3><p>At the end of the operation, a special bandage is applied after blepharoplasty. The dressing has a cooling effect, which helps to prevent the formation of bruising and edema.</p><p>On the first day after the surgical intervention, the patient should remain in the hospital under the supervision of a surgeon, but the next day you can go home. The first two days of recovery from blepharoplasty should avoid contact with water, as well as excessive eye strain, such as reading, watching TV, working at the computer.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2746" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

<li>Rotation of eyeballs;</li>
<li>Slight pressure on the eyeballs through closed eyelids;</li>
<li>Moving the look up and down.</li>
</ol><p>Doctors recommend using special antiseptic drops during recovery after blepharoplasty, then for the first three days. On the fifth day of rehabilitation it is necessary to undergo a scheduled examination, where sutures will be removed. You must comply with all the necessary prescriptions of the doctor during the recovery.</p><p>And if the rehabilitation process is successful, the seams become less noticeable after 3 weeks from the day of the operation. The final effect is estimated after 1.5 months. During this time, the edema subsides, and the incision site completely heals. It is necessary to use a special cream after blepharoplasty so that the postoperative scars are less noticeable.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2747" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><h3>How to choose a surgeon for blepharoplasty?</h3><p>In this section we will tell you about what you need to pay attention to avoid common mistakes when choosing a plastic surgeon for blepharoplasty. You should be taken responsibly to the choice of a plastic surgeon, since this specialist will help you get closer to your dream.</p><h4>Education of the surgeon.</h4><p>A real plastic surgeon must have a higher medical education, as well as a minimum package of documents, confirming the right to carry out plastic surgeries. A highly qualified specialist in the field of blepharoplasty, anticipating the individual characteristics of the patient, will help not only to avoid a variety of complications, but also to re-operation on the eyelids.</p><p>Remember, first of all, repeated operation for blepharoplasty is not recommended, and secondly, repeated blepharoplasty is technically much more difficult than primary blepharoplasty.</p><p>The skill of the surgeon is developed exclusively by practice – tens and hundreds of operations, which on average is about 8-10 years of active surgical practice.</p><h4>Specialization of plastic surgeon.</h4><p>When choosing a plastic surgeon, you need to make sure, that he specializes in the operation you have chosen – blepharoplasty and that it is one of the main, priority in his practice.</p><h4>Cost of services</h4><p>In plastic surgery, prices are a very conditional thing, and eyelid surgery (blepharoplasty) is no exception. However, it should be understood that if the cost of this operation is clearly understated, then you are at risk. Therefore, you should not trust the discounts and promotions of the clinic. A qualified specialist, like a good clinic, does not need to hold such actions, due the reputation which has been earned for many years.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2749" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-0297449e47bc5b26dc0b885dffcb9392">

</div><p><strong>Choosing A Blepharoplasty Surgeon</strong></p><p>A facial plastic surgeon, oculoplastic surgeon, or general plastic surgeon are all qualified to perform upper blepharoplasty surgery.</p><p>With any surgeon, a patient needs to ensure the physician’s expertise with this type of procedure. Find a surgeon that regularly performs this procedure, and ask to see before/after photos of their work!</p><p>Your surgeon should be board certified with expertise in blepharoplasty surgery. You can discuss this issue with your surgeon and ask how many procedures have been performed.</p><p>I agree with everyone in that anyone comfortable doing bleph’s is fine so long as they are board certified and have plenty of experience. Just make sure your surgeon knows that you have dry eye preoperatively so that a conservative bleph is done.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2750" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-195da8fb3d7204625cf049dc2e131a8d">

In our practice we have our own accredited surgicenter and most of our upper eyelid patients can even have the procedure comfortably done under a local anesthesia.</p><p>There are excellent oculoplastic surgeons and plastic surgeons that can handle a standard upper lid blepharoplasty.</p><p><b>Does it matter whether I get an Upper blepharoplasty from an Oculoplastic Surgeon or a cosmetic plastic surgeon?</b></p><p>There are excellent plastic surgeons certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery and ideally members of the American Society for aesthetic Plastic Surgery (ASAPS), facial plastic sugeons (generally otolaryngologists), and oculoplastic surgeons who are fully trained to operate on the eyelids.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2751" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-f6666612bdcd33b20bb30a1589b33f5c">

Regarding dry eyes, upper blepharoplasties lead to fewer problems than lower blepharoplasties, and any surgeon with experience with blehparoplasty can manage your mild dry eye symptoms if they worsen postop.</p><h3>Who is best to perform upper and lower blepharoplasty</h3><p>In short, if you are pleased with the results you have seen and you trust this doctor, you should feel comfortable proceeding with your surgery. If you have questions, it can never hurt to talk to another doctor that might come highly recommended as well.</p><p>Facial plastic surgeons, oculoplastic surgeons, and plastic surgeons are all typically trained in these procedures, particularly if they are board certified, but there are varying degrees of experience once in practice; some focus on largely body work and do very little facial work, and some do very little cosmetic work.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2753" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>We perform almost exclusively cosmetic facial surgery and we feel that allows a greater attention to facial details, including the eyelids.</p><p>As an example, we are careful to avoid an incision that places you at risk for lowering/drooping the lower eyelid and giving “scleral show” or white show below the colored part of your eye.</p><p>We also take great care to balance the eyes with the cheek and brow regions, so our patients achieve the most harmonious result possible–many times this involves precise, small additions of volume to brow and upper cheek areas.</p><p>I have had volume restoration myself to the tear trough/upper cheek area and feel it made a significant improvement, as do others. Many of the patients in the link below had eyelid surgery with volume restoration.</p><p>This is elective surgery and there is no rush to proceed until you are completely comfortable.</p><h3>Best type of surgeon to perform upper/lower blepharoplasty</h3><p>Facial plastic surgeons, plastic surgeons, and oculoplastic surgeons are all well qualified to perform upper and lower blepharoplasty. If you have a rapport with your surgeon and they have nice results, you should not get hung up on the subspecialty.</p><p>Your board-certified plastic certain is more than capable of performing your blepharoplasty treatment. An oculoplastic surgeon is also equally qualified to do so. Must trust your instincts as to which professional should address your issues so that you are comfortable proceeding with the procedure.</p><h5>For upper and lower blepharoplasty surgery, is it best to have an Oculoplastic Surgeon perform the surgery?</h5><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2755" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Your fears are unfounded. I would say that board certified plastic surgeons do eyelid surgeries all the time and I would say that to think that occuloplastic surgeon can do it better is a misconception.</p><p>Occuloplastic or plastic , both are fine as long as they are board certified and you are satisfied with the treatment plan</p><p><i>Is it best to have an oculoplastic surgeon perform upper and lower blepharoplasty?</i></p><p>Facial plastic surgeons, plastic surgeons and oculoplastic surgeons can all perform blepharoplasty surgery. One speciality is not necessarily better than the other. The decision of which surgeon to use should be based more on the individual.</p><p>Since you state you have seen your surgeon for facial fillers and been satisfied, I see no reason why you should not be confident in his ability to perform surgery on your eyelids. You know this is a procedure he performs and have seen his work, so unless you are uncomfortable with something else, I think there is no need to have second thoughts.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2756" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>The varied opinions among qualified surgeons is not surprising. Each surgeon, like any other artist, has a unique way of getting the desired results. Typically upper eyelid surgeon is a little more consistent procedure, but lower eyelid and upper facial surgery can be very different depending on the needs of the patient, and the experience of the surgeon.</p><p>I prefer to always tighten the lower eyelid during blepharoplasty surgery to prevent rounding of the lower eyelid, and to help elevate laxity associated with the orbicularis muscle. failure to do so can result in residual wrinkles or rounding of the eye, depending on either less aggressive or more aggressive treatment.</p><p>An additional component to lower eyelid surgery is C02 resurfacing which helps improve the fine textural changes. My advice is to choose the surgeon who has the best results for your particular problem .</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2757" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Plastic surgery is an art, and prices vary even in the same region depending upon the surgeon’s experience, reputation, and results. Photos would be helpful, but even with them an in-person exam is crucial to determine the best plan.</p><p>Fat removal can cause the wrinkling to worsen, but not always. I generally do one of 3 treatments with the lower eyelid blepharoplasty to improve and lessen postoperative wrinkles: 1) chemical peels; 2) fraxel resurfacing; 3) conservative skin removal.</p><p>Botox injections can also be helpful depending if the lines are dynamically caused. I remove less skin than the other treatments I mentioned because it is safer to avoid changing the eye shape or worse yet causing lower eyelid malpositions such as retraction, ectropion.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2758" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-786f37e2dcabe0adfd2b6382831f14c7">

</div><p>Midface lifting can improve the immediate and the long-term results if its needed. I have to manage many postoperative complications or undesired results from other surgeons, and its better to avoid these issues to begin with.</p><p>I would strongly encourage you to go with the surgeon you are most comfortable with that has the best reputation.
