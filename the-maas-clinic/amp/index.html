<div class="fullTableCell">It is great that you have taken the time to learn some anatomy however, this deformity is clearly more than just alar cartilage weakness. The ability to compress your entire tip suggests real deficiency in your nasal septum strength or even prescience (after surgery). At a minimum you will need a strong graft between the two Alar cartilages at the nasal tip and possible more. This is not difficult with an experienced facial plastic and Rhinoplasty surgeon.
