</div>I would strongly recommend assessment by an oculoplastic surgeon. This is a board certified ophthalmologist who has completed a fellowship training in eye plastic surgery. 
<p>The American Society for Ophthalmic Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery maintains a website that can help you locate a well qualified surgeon in your area (www.ASOPRS.org). As these are very specialized issues, it is best to see a fellowship trained eye plastic surgeon rather than a generalist like a board certified general plastic surgeon or a facial plastic surgeon</p><p>And yes, the results of surgery need to last a lifetime. </p><h5>18 is too young for upper blepharoplasty</h5><p>18 is too young for upper eyelid surgery unless it is for creating a double lid in an asian eye. Your baby sitter might be looking angry and tired because of wrinkles between eyebrows, crows feet or forehead</p><p>She might benefit from Botox. Have her consider other options before getting into upper eyelid surgery. </p><p><strong>Upper eyelid surgery (Blepharoplasty) is often OK for young adults</strong></p><p>Upper eyelid cosmetic surgery (Blepharoplasty) is not a problem for an 18 year old. However, just like every other patient, it is important that problem be correctly identified and the proper procedure is performed. For most 18 year olds droopy eyelids can mean: That there is two much fullness off the upper eyelid That the muscle that lifts the eyelid is not working properly so the edge of the eyelid itself is too low In some patients both of these problems are present<br>
</p>
<div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_100213" class="wp-caption alignleft amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div>If the problem is with the muscle should be corrected at the time of surgery. If the problem is upper eyelid fullness than the answer will probably be removal of skin and fat. However that should be done in a very conservative manner
<p>As we age upper eyelids can become more hollow. When a young person has surgery that possibility should be taken into account. </p><h5>Upper blepharoplasty for an 18 year old</h5><p>More important than the age is the anatomical situation and the goals your sister wants to achieve with an upper eyelid lift. It sounds like that she would like a resculpting of the lids as there should be no age-related changes at 18</p><p>She should visit with an experienced facial aesthetic surgeon to discuss her concerns and to be thoroughly examined. Risks associated with blepharoplasty are multifold but not different than in oder people. In addition, upper blepharoplasty is commonly performed in young people of Asian heritage in order to improve lid definition<br>

</div><h4>Diagnosis of the upper eyelids first: dermatochalasis, blepharochalasis, ptosis, etc.</h4><p>At young, age is not a factor in producing the appearance you describe, so a proper diagnosis first is essential. Most upper eyelid rejuvenation is directed at correcting dermatochalasis, which is an age-related change</p><p>In younger patients, a diagnosis such as blepharochalasis–a recurring and relapsing inflammatory condition of the lids–is more likely. The other key issue is to determine whether she has true ptosis of the eyelids, which can be the result of a spectrum of anatomic and neuromuscular disorders</p><p>Eyelid ptosis is managed quite a bit differently than a simple blepharoplasty. Anyway, the point is that younger patients with eyelid concerns should make sure to have a complete ophthalmologic exam first.</p><h4>Congenital Ptosis or Myasthenia Gravis?</h4><p>Droopiness of the upper eyelids is rare in young age. Has the problem been apparent since she was an infant or toddler? Is she able to raise her upper eyelids or are they always droopy? Are there certain times of the day when the problem is worse? Please obtain an evaluation from a reputable Board Certified Plastic Surgeon<br>

</div>Your sister may need more than just cosmetic upper eyelid blepharoplasties. Her doctor must rule out pathological conditions such as mysasthenia gravis and congenital muscular dystrophies/congenital ptosis. I don’t mean to alarm you. I just want to make sure that your sister is appropriately evaluated before she proceeds
<h4>Upper eyelid lift, or is it really ptosis repair?</h4><p>In my opinion 18 is too young to do an eyelid lift. That being said, some people have a problem called ptosis, or drooping eyelid. This is a surgically correctable problem that involves the eyelid muscle and should be properly evaluated by a plastic surgeon with much experience in eyelid surgery or an oculoplastic surgeon</p><p>Before rushing into surgery why not suggest you go with your sister to see if this is her problem. If it is not and it is just a cosmetic problem I would certainly recommend she wait some years before going ahead with cosmetic eyelid surgery<br>

</div><h4>Is 16 Too Young for Eyelid Surgery? </h4><p>You seem to be developing ptosis of the upper eye lids. There may be medical reasons for this and you should be evaluated by an Ophthalmologist.   Sometimes there is no groove, and lower transconjunctival blepharoplasty may be a better option. You may wish to consult a reputable facial plastic surgeon to see what might be best for you. (Robert D. Goldstein, MD, Bronx Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Upper blepharoplasty for 29 YO?</i></p><p>Having excessive upper lid skin is often a familial trait and can be bothersome at a young age. Simple removal of upper lid skin (upper blepharoplasty) would probably work very well for you. Likewise excessive lower lid fat prolapse and/or thinning lid tissue (tear trough deformity) can show up at a young age.<br>

</div>This can be improved with filler injection or surgery. Consult with a facial plastic or ophthalmic plastic surgeon. (Peter T. Truong, MD, Fresno Oculoplastic Surgeon)
<p><strong>Upper eyelid drooping</strong></p><p>You may benefit from a range of procedures and you can start with non-surgical such as Botox and Ultherapy and then progress to possible endoscopic brow lift and upper blepharoplasty with removal of excess skin.</p><p>You would certainly need to have an in person evaluation and consultation with an experienced facial plastic, general plastic or occuloplastic surgeon to discuss your options. (Edwin Ishoo, MD, Cambridge Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>while i cant give specific medical advice over the internet, i think if you were to show up in my office interested in a upper lid bleph, I would offer it to you. i have additional occuloplastic training and see many patients like you.<br>

<p><i>Eyelid puffiness</i></p><p>I think that filling the tear trough with a filler will only temporarily hide your bags and a better and more permanent fix will be using a lower lid blepharoplasty.  I don’t think that you are at risk for scleral show post op or with aging. (John Dean, MD, Baton Rouge Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Bags</i></p><p>It is not unusual to have “bags” at a young age. You appear to be a candidate for a trans conjunctival approach, removing the bags with out an external incision. Don’t worry about scleral show , however make sure the surgeon you see is qualified in this area, i.e. plastic surgeon or opthalmic plastic surgeon. (Barry M.

</div><h5>Consider non surgical options first</h5><p>Frequently encountered issue. By the photos, it appears you have early prominent fat pads in your lower lids. Fillers beneath the bulging fat will help this in most cases, but removing the fat and/or placing in into the tear trough is a more permanent fix. You should not have rounding or show if the transconjunctival route is taken. (Jeffrey Joseph, MD, FACS, Lafayette Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Filling tear troughs</b></p><p>You do not need a blepharoplasty.You appear to be a candidate for Restylane to improve the tear troughs. See a board certified plastic surgeon in your area for a consultation. (Robert L.

</div><h5>Dermal Fillers should help your lower lid and cheek contour</h5><p>I assumed from your question that you were referring to your lower lid-cheek contour. I also assumed you were not referring to your upper lids. That being stated, yours is a situation where the eyelid to cheek contour gives the appearance that the lower lids are too full but in reality it appears that the cheek area and the tear trough are too hollow.</p><p>Expertly placed dermal fillers should be ideal for you. (J. Timothy Heffernan, MD, Seattle Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Blepharoplasty VS. Fillers to Tear Troughs</i></p><p>Personally, I would decline to perform a Blepharoplasty on you. You have pretty eyes, ethereal you may say, which would NOT be improved by the operation but COULD be made worse. I suspect that in frightening you with scar tissue etc, the surgeon was also trying to save you from making such a decision.<br>

</div>(If you carefully examine your photograph you would notice mild “SCLERAL SHOW” (white conjunctiva being seen under the pigmented portion in the center of the globe) – this IMPLIES you have laxity of the lower lid.
<p>If operated on without correcting the laxity, the downward pull may become worse and lead to an exaggerated pulled lid (Look for Ectropion on Google pictures). I think you would do great with Restylane to the Tear Trough.</p><p>Why don’t you ask the Plastic surgeon who honestly ?shooed you away how he would feel about this option? (Peter A.
