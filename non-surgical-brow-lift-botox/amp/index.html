On close examination of your upper lids, I see a mild asymmetry. If pushed to choose, I like the look of your Right upper lid (the one you do not like) than the left</p><p>You do NOT require any skin tightening by laser, IPL or any other means and had you presented to my office I would tell you that in person. The odds that anyone can vastly improve on the look you currently have is very small</p><p>But the odds that many can make you look worse is actually quite significant.</p><h4>Upper lid issues in a 27 year old</h4><p>In my opinion, you are too young and have too little going on in your upper lid to warrant surgery. The skin tightening treatments you mention don’t work consistently well to be worth the money</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_100109" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>You might try a Botox eyebrowlift as the subtle elevation of your brow will probably eliminate the minor issue in the (your left) upper lid.</p><h4>The Enemy Of Good Is Better</h4><p>Your pictures suggest the presence of beautiful eyes with minimal asymmetry. Under these circumstances, surgical intervention isn’t justified by the risk benefit ratio. Furthermore, most of the non-surgical treatments don’t have proven efficacy for this type of problem</p><p>For this reason, doing nothing is probably the best option.

</div><p>I have performed Blepharoplasty and Brow Lifts for over 20 years and don’t believe that any Laser or RF procedures, currently on the market, will have the same predictability or success in removing excess upper eyelid skin that an Upper Blepharoplasty would provide</p><p>You may want to have 2-3 consultations withj plastic and cosmetic surgeons or Occuloplastic surgeons who and experienced in eyebrow Lifts and Upper Blepharoplasty.</p><h3>Surgery and laser in young people</h3><p>You mentoned eyelid position. Do you mean the where the eyelid edge is positioned on your eye or are you talking about the skin above the eyelid?

</div><p>That is relatively subjective. I would need an update on that answer to properly answer your question.</p><h3>Nonsurgical approach is plenty</h3><p>As I look at your picture you have some asymmetry in the height of your brows and I think this is the reason for any subtle difference in your eye lids. I do recommend any surgical procedure or other skin tightening procedure for you</p><p>A lot of the difference you see is due to the difference in skeletal structure on the right and left side; almost every one has it. The only thing I would recommend is a trial of Botox to see if the brows can be adjusted which would also impact the upper eye lid appearance</p><p>Botox is not permanent but with the proper application I think you can achieve the subtle difference you would like.</p><p></p>

</div><p>You have very mild redundancy of the upper lids. A simple skin removal would be a small procedure, but it is surgical.

Not uncommonly, I will place a small amount of Botox near the brow to create better symmetry</p><p>This can be accomplished by allowing the stronger muscle to compensate to even the eyebrow and eyelid out.

</div><p>It does require about 3 treatments, that are performed abut 2 weeks apart. You should notice improvement within a few weeks of the first treatment. Most importantly, don’t have surgery. Your eyes are quite attractive, and surgery will do little to achieve the improvement you are seeking</p><p><em>Proceed with non-surgical upper eyelid improvement with caution</em></p><p>It would be a shame to mess up your beautiful face. The resurfacing procedures you mentioned are very modest. You may not feel you received value for the money spent on the procedure</p><p>I agree that a Botox forehead lift would be great for you. A non-surgical alternative would be some Restylane in the left eyebrow which would raise the left brow and reduce the left upper eyelid fold</p><p>I would explore with you a micro-blepharoplasty for the left upper eyelid to remove a small amount of skin from the left upper eyelid as well.</p><p><i>Crows feet and dynamic wrinkles </i></p><p>Aging skin thins and shows wrinkles in areas of repetitive folding. The muscle activity underneath as well as the amount of skin laxity can contribute to this appearance. Botox weakens this muscle activity making the dynamic wrinkles less pronounced.</p><p>Laser resurfacing and chemical peels can tighten and thicken the skin which will soften the wrinkles. In cases of too much laxity, skin can be removed by surgery. Fillers can touch up etched lines and stiffen the skin.</p><p>You should consult a qualified physician to help decide which of these options should be considered to achieve your goals. (Stephen Fink, DO FAOCO, Newport Beach Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Do I need a lower Blepharoplasty or would botox do the job?</h4><p>Try Botox first with some HA fillers. Than if you still not happy seek surgery of the lower lids (Darryl J. Blinski, MD, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Fixing hooded eyelids </b></p><p></p>

</div>Hooded or baggy upper eyes and brow. By relaxing the brow muscles Botox can aggravate the heaviness of your eyelids. The muscle atrophy from Botox is not permanent, however skin laxity is. The most thorough and lasting cure for upper eyelid skin laxity and hooding is an upper eyelid blepharoplasty where the extra eyelid skin is trimmed.
<p>This can be followed with a non-surgical brow lift using a hyaluronic acid filler. (Karen Stolman, MD, Sandy Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Botox could help to slightly lift your eyebrows</b></p><p>Botox could slightly lift your eyebrows and therefore reduce the heaviness of the eyelids.

</div>If the eyebrow is only slightly “deflated” then fillers will be the answer. If the position of the eyebrow is too low and the eyelid too heavy, younger have to consider surgery. Your doctor will assess you and advise you for the best option (Andrea Marando, MD, Manchester Plastic Surgeon)
<p><strong>Botox should not harm blepharoplasty result</strong></p><p>Botox works wonderfully for crows feet and helps open or lift the brow to help make the lid look open and bright. The Botox may last up to six months, however most of our patients now come in for Botox at four month intervals.</p><p>Your Botox four months before your lid rejuvenation should not affect the result. You are likely to continue the Botox after to keep the dynamic lines as soft as possible, but again your result should be just fine. (Peter E. Johnson, MD, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>It all depends on if the Botox was still active.</i></p><p>It all depends on if the Botox was still active. If you have functioning Botox at the time of the belpharoplasty (which means that the orbicularis muscle was partially paralyzed leading to an elevation of the lateral brow) then when it wears off, you may get a little extra fullness laterally where the skin is no longer stretched from the elevation of the brow.</p><p>However, in all likelihood, you are going to continue with the Botox for your crow’s feet, so the concern is really a non-tissue. (David Shafer, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Botox effect is minimal at 4 months</b></p><p>Crows feet Botox can have some effect on brow position and this should be evident in lateral eyelid hooding. The small difference is not likely to have a big impact on the upper eyelid excision for the blepharoplasty.</p><p>However, the Botox effect is maximal at 3 weeks and by 4 months there is almost no effect left. This should have a minimal effect on your surgery. Regarding when you should evaluate the results of surgery, almost all surgeries take much longer to heal than we think.</p><p>By 10 days most bruising is resolved. By 6 to 8 weeks, most swelling has settled down but it may be 6 to 12 months to achieve what most would consider a complete healing. (Kenneth D. Steinsapir, MD, Beverly Hills Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Blepharoplasty does not correct crows feet</h3><p>Blepharoplasty does not correct crow’s feet. A long time ago, plastic surgeons attempted to remove the muscle that causes crow’s feet with disastrous results. The area became hollow and very unatural appearing. Today, an upper bleph treats the skin and fat of the upper lid.</p><p></p>

</div>The best and only way to treat crow’s feet is with BOTOX. But the two should not affect the other. However, BOTOX to the forehead can affect the surgeons ability to mark the correct amount of skin to be removed during an upper blepharoplasty. (Robert M. Freund, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)
<h5>Botox is temporary</h5><p>The effect of Botox generally lasts from 4-6 months. It is rare to see a more prolonged effect. The effect of botox on the crow’s feet should be minimal in assessing the results from an upper lid blepharoplasty.</p><p>Treatment of the forehead would have a more significant impact since these muscles can have a greater effect on brow position, which could impact the appearance of your upper eyelids. (Mitchel Krieger, MD, Fairfax Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Botox should have no effect on Blepharoplasty result</h4><p>It is unlikely that Botox injected for crow feet would affect your upper lid surgery. Large doses injected below the brow to elevate it might raise the brow and induce a false correction. This might lead to less skin excision (Hisham Seify, MD, PhD, FACS, Orange County Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Your plastic surgeon may be reputable but the service is not helping you.</em></p><p>First your forehead is hammered by botox causing the forehead to fall. It may be glass smooth but paralysis is not pretty. Juvederm is not the ideal lower eyelid filler. You actually need more volume in the hollow under eye area.</p><p>You have upper eyelid ptosis. Do you think this was there before the Botox service or do you think the service caused upper eyelid ptosis. My father, an internist from Brooklyn, liked to tell me: “When the butcher tells you the meat is bad, you should listen.”</p><p>The fact that this surgeon did not want to perform eyelid surgery may be telling you more about what the surgeon thinks of their own eyelid surgery skill. I think you would benefit from upper eyelid surgery which would include anchor blepharoplasty and ptosis repair.</p><p>A personal consultation is essential to determine a definitive surgical plan.(Kenneth D. Steinsapir, MD, Beverly Hills Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Almost 40 told look to freshen up eyes/eyelids. Fillers and Botox not giving me the result I desire.</h4><p>You have mild Ptosis ( droopy upper eyelid) that can be fixed with Surgery. The excess skin can be corrected at the same time. The lower lids have excess skin and would benefit from skin excision.</p><p>Botox will not address these issues. Fillers replace lost volume in the under eye areas and improve the aesthetics of the area around the eye. (Naveen Somia, MBBS, PhD, FRACS, Sydney Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Four eyelid blepharoplasty with laser skin resurfacing</h3><p>It appears that you require blepharoplasty on both the upper and lower eyelids. Laser skin resurfacing would improve the texture of the lower eyelid skin. See a board-certified Oculoplastic Surgeon for comprehensive evaluation and guidance with an appropriate treatment plan.(James R. Gordon, MD, FACS, FAAO, New York Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p><p><b> I want to correct hoodding and open up my eyes</b></p><p>A brow lift is unnecessary, since the height of the eyebrows is acceptable.  A conservative skin only upper blepharoplasty can accomplish rejuvenating the upper eyelids.  For more information, please see the link and the video below. (William Portuese, MD, Seattle Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Upper Lid Blepharoplasty</em></p><p>Your brows seem to be in good position. You will benefit from an upper lid blepharoplasty with a 1-2 week recovery. Typically, my patients return to work in about a week. Your epicanthic folds is not an issue.</p><p>You can see a board certified plastic surgeon, facial plastic surgeon or occuloplastic surgeon for this operation. For your lower lids, you can consider resurfacing with either laser or a chemical peel.(Homaira (Myra) Danish, MD, Troy Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Correct hooding</b></p><p>I think you’re an excellent candidate for upper lid blepharoplasty. You appear to have a significant amount of excess creppy skin and a loss of your eyelid platform. I think you will love your results.</p><p>I am against a brow lift as I don’t think the results will look natural.(Katrinka L. Heher, MD, Boston Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p><h5>I want to correct hooding & open up my eyes. What is the right procedure form? What type of surgeon do I need?</h5><p>Based upon the only 1 posted photo my recommendation is upper lid blepharoplasty before any brow lifting. But in person opinions best. (Darryl J. Blinski, MD, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Upper bleph procedure</h3><p>I would suggest a browlift alone will not be sufficient and you will need a bleph procedure. You can lift your eyebrows slightly with some botox or filler saving you a surgical lift.</p><p>Without a bleph I would imagine you will be disappointed. Seek a plastic surgeon is my advice.(Ali Soueid, FRCS ( Plast), London Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
