Often, when performing eyelid surgery, we use sutures that dissolve in 5 to 10 days when placing stitches in the skin. These are considered fast absorbing stitches. In general, the faster stitches dissolve, the less chance of leaving stitch marks.</p><p>We have to balance our desire to remove the stitches quickly with the need for the incision to become strong. On the other hand, we sometimes use other types of dissolving stitches on the deeper layers.</p><p>For example, I prefer a strong, relatively long-lasting stitch before it dissolves when I am suspending the lower eyelid muscle while performing lower eyelid surgery. This allows the eyelid to heal this area adequately. This stitch is deep under the skin and is not seen. ( George Volpe, MD , Boston Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>When will your sutures dissolve?</h3><p>We have many different types of dissolving sutures in our arsenal. Hands-down, the most commonly used for upper eyelid surgery is going to be fast absorbing gut, or what your surgeon probably called “fast gut.”</p><p>Fast absorbing gut takes approximately eight or nine days to dissolve, give or take a few days in either direction. The suture doesn’t truly “dissolve” on its own, our body actually breaks down the proteins in the suture, so it’s only really going to dissolve in the areas that are under your skin, which can lead to the appearance of retained sutures because they may still be sitting on top of your skin even though they are not connected underneath anymore.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_471" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-a02e3536d677ec7abba3c40f82b44f46">

</div><p>The best thing you can do is keep your wound moist with an ointment, and if the suture seems to have been there too long and is concerning you, go see your surgeon. If it concerns you, it should concern them.</p><p>To guarantee you’re receiving the highest level of care, seek out a dermatologic surgeon, oculoplastic surgeon, facial plastic surgeon or plastic surgeon who is board certified and fellowship trained in one of these “core four” cosmetic specialties. ( Cameron Chesnut, MD, FAAD, FACMS, FASDS , Spokane Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h3>Eyelid surgery stitches</h3><p>I use removable suture because absorbable suture dint absorb fast enough. Consider going back to your surgeon who can remove the suture for you. At eight days, the stitches should be gone. ( Ronald J. Edelson, MD , San Diego Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Eyelid surgery stitches</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_473" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Eyelid surgery stitches may take 1 – 2 weeks to dissolve depending on the material used. They can also be removed early. ( Jose E. Barrera, MD, FACS , San Antonio Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>How long do eyelid sutures last?</h3><p>It depends on the type of suture material used, however the most commonly used suture can be expected to the dissolve and fall off in a little over a week.

</div><p>I assume your surgeon used fast-absorb sutures. These “dissolve” in three to five days. However, the sutures are not gone. Usually, they start to fray and fall apart but can still be observed in the eyelid. Gentle soaks can help remove them. Your surgeon will remove them from the eyelid if present for more than five days. This will help optimize the scar. ( Jason Mussman, MD , Phoenix Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Time for sutures to dissolve</h3><p>It all depends on the type of dissolving suture that was used. Plain fast absorbing gut made by Ethicon will dissolve in a week. Regular plain gut may take 10-12 days. Monocryl suture (Ethicon) could take 3 to 4 weeks. Typically, if the suture hasn’t dissolved in a 7-10 day period we would remove them to improve the final scar result. ( Franklin D. Richards, MD , Bethesda Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Stitches</h3><p>Resorbable sutures dissolve depending the material used. Deep sutures may take a few weeks to months.</p><p>Resorbable skin sutures usually dissolve by 7-10 days.</p><p>It will be sooner if area is kept moist. Sometimes they may require removal if dried out and not dissolving. ( Donald Nunn, MD , Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Stitches Dissolving After Eyelid Surgery</h3><p>Most dissolvable stitches dissolve by approximately 2 weeks. It all depends on the metabolism rate of the material within your body.</p><p>But that’s already too scientific of a discussion than we need to have. No need to make them dissolve faster.</p><p>As I always say: Respect Your Body. Give it the time it needs to heal, and definitely keep in good communication with your surgeon. Follow his/her instructions and you should be alright. ( Daniel Kaufman, MD, FACS , New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Dissolvable Blepharoplasty Sutures (Stitches)</h3><p>There are different types of dissolvable sutures. The fat absorbing sutures dissolve in 7 to 10 days. Most dissolvable sutures take 30 to 60 days. You can generally aide the process by keeping the incisions moisturized.</p><p>Consult with your surgeon as he or she knows the scope of the surgery and the specifics about you. (Kris M. Reddy, MD, FACS , West Palm Beach Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Dissolvable Blepharoplasty Stitches?</h3><p>I don’t use external dissolving stitches as they are very fragile and they last for variable amounts of time. They may last longer then we want or they may dissolve sooner then we would like with the wound opening up. I find that fine prolene non dissolving sutures are the best. ( Jonathan Pontell, MD, FACS , Philadelphia Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Blepharoplasty sutures</h3><p>It depends on what type of suture was used. I use fast-absorbing gut suture, which, if I left it in place, would dissolve away in only a few weeks. Most surgeons, like myself, remove the sutures after 7-10 days. Placing eyelid-appropriate antibiotic ointment on the incision line can make the sutures dissolve faster. (Clyde Mathison, MD , Knoxville Otolaryngologist)</p><h3>Dissolvable Blepharoplasty sutures</h3><p>It really depends on what type of sutures were used. They can dissolve quickly, as in a couple of weeks, or take longer. You should ask your surgeon what you should expect. ( Michael Constantin Gartner, DO , Paramus Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>How long does it take for stitches to dissolve after eyelid surgery?</h3><p>On average though, if your surgeon used plain gut sutures, it will take about 10-30 days. It is a wide range, because everyone dissolves at different speeds. At your post-op appointment, make sure to ask your doctor about the stitches. I often remove the stitches if they are bothering my patients, but leave them alone if they are falling out on their own. ( Dan Landmann, MD , Ridgewood Ophthalmologist)</p><h3>Absorbable Blepharoplasty sutures</h3><p>It depends on the type of sutures used. They can dissolve in a week or so, or take a month or two. It’s best to let them dissolve on their own. ( Jerome Edelstein, MD , Toronto Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Eyelid surgery stitches</h3><p>The small sutures which are used for closing eyelid lift or blepharoplasty incisions usually dissolve within one to two weeks. If they are still present your surgeon may remove them during that time period. If they are irritating your eye tissue discuss your concerns with your surgeon. ( Andrew Goldberg, MD , Fairfax Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>How long until stitches dissolve</h3><p>The stitches start dissolving as early as 3-4 days and as long as many weeks. In general incisions are well healed by one week but this can vary. I recommend gentle rubbing of the sutures after showering at the 10 day mark. Keeping them moist with the ointment is also helpful. If they continue to bother you your surgeon can remove them for you. ( Katrinka L. Heher, MD , Boston Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p><h3>There Are Many Different Types of Stitches Than Can Be Used During Eyelid Surgery</h3><p>I usually like to use sutures that need to be removed in the office because it leaves a much nicer incision. While annoying to return to have them removed, I think that it is worth it in the long run. Most of the time, dissolving sutures will be gone by 1-2 weeks, but it depends on the material that is used. If they are not gone at the time of the first visit after surgery, your surgeon should be able to clean off the remaining pieces. ( Samuel Baharestani, MD , Long Island Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Eyelid stitches Usually Dissolve Within The 1st Week of Recovery. Ask Your Surgeon.</h3><p>There are many different types of dissolving stitches that plastic surgeons have to choose from and each have their own qualities and length of duration. Typically, the stitches used for an eyelid surgery tend to be very small in caliber (thickness) and tend to dissolve relatively quickly.</p><p>Ideally, those stitches should come out between one to two weeks after surgery. If they have not fallen out by then, your surgeon will probably take them out. There is danger to having them out too quickly so do not do anything before your surgeon gives you the go ahead. Only he or she knows exactly what was done underneath and when it is safe to remove them.Typically, after the first week it would be alright to apply a cool moist sponge or gauze on the incisions to allow the dissolving process to speed up.</p><p>If stitches stay much longer than two weeks, you are likely to develop little track marks on either side of the incision from the stitches and therefore a worse scar. The best advice is always to ask your surgeon what to do and why as they know the particular details of your situation and will have your best intentions in mind. ( Marie E. Montag, MD , Omaha Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>How long does does it take for eyelid sutures to dissolve.</h3><p>It all depends on what type of sutures were used. Generally though, sutures dissolve anywhere from 5-14 days. I usually remove sutures on day 6 or 7 after eyelid surgery, whether they are the dissolvable kind or not. (Christopher I. Zoumalan, MD, FACS , Beverly Hills Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p><h3>How Long Until Plastic Surgery Stitches Dissolve?</h3><p>How long until the eyelid stitches dissolve is dependent on the type of stitch. Most dissolvable eyelid stitches used in eyelid surgery dissolve between 7 and14 days. Other stitches can take long even 4 weeks to dissolve.</p><p>Eyelids heal very quickly and stitches are required for less that 1-week. After this time it is good to have the stich removed as it can irritate the skin and increase the thickness of the scar. (Julian De Silva, MD , London Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Dissolving Sutures</h3><p>Depending upon the exact suture material they used it could take up to two weeks or more. Applying topical antibiotic will help solubilize the suture material but it really depends upon your immune system.</p><p>By 7-9 days after surgery you can ask your eye doctor to simply remove the sutures directly so you do not have to have the common problem with external sutures – Milia.</p><p>Using a subcuticular closure with a non-absorbable suture allows me to remove it on the 7th day and reduces the risk of Milia. ( Paul Vanek, MD , Cleveland Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>How long until plastic surgery eyelid stitches dissolve?</h3><p>Depends on the sutures used most of them will dissolve within 6days-6 weeks depends on the type they used. ( Jhonny Salomon, MD , Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Dissolving Eyelid Surgery Stitches</h3><p>Size “6-0 fast-absorbing gut” sutures are most commonly used with eyelid surgery. These will consistently dissolve by 7-10 days if the patient is using hydrogen peroxide to clean the incisions and sutures, and applying an antibiotic ointment as well.</p><p>Both the hydrogen peroxide and the ointment help the sutures dissolve. Although the hydrogen peroxide speeds this process more than the ointment, it can also bleach the eyelids if used too much, so should not be used more often than 2 times per day.</p><p>Often, these sutures will become soft and unravel, at which point they can be grabbed and removed with a fine forceps even before they dissolve. ( Richard Parfitt, MD , Madison Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Time for eyelid stitches to dissolve</h3><p>Most dissolvable eyelid stitches used in eyelid surgery are made of gut, which dissolves in 7-14 days if you are using adequate ointment. If they are left dry, they may take longer. Some surgeons use some Vicryl sutures, which take 3-4 weeks or more to dissolve. ( Matheson A. Harris, MD , Salt Lake City Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p></div>
